Livewire provides a variety of lifecycle hooks that allow you to execute code at specific points during a component's lifecycle. These hooks enable you to perform actions before or after particular events, such as initializing the component, updating properties, or rendering the template.
Here's a list of all the available component lifecycle hooks:
In a standard PHP class, a constructor (__construct()) takes in outside parameters and initializes the object's state. However, in Livewire, you use the mount() method for accepting parameters and initializing the state of your component.
Livewire components don't use __construct() because Livewire components are re-constructed on subsequent network requests, and we only want to initialize the component once when it is first created.
Here's an example of using the mount() method to initialize the name and email properties of a profile.edit component:
// resources/views/components/profile/⚡edit.blade.phpuse Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;use Livewire\Component;new class extends Component { public $name; public $email; public function mount() { $this->name = Auth::user()->name; $this->email = Auth::user()->email; } // ...};
// resources/views/components/profile/⚡edit.blade.php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
$this->name = Auth::user()->name;
$this->email = Auth::user()->email;
As mentioned earlier, the mount() method receives data passed into the component as method parameters:
// resources/views/components/post/⚡edit.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Post;new class extends Component { public $title; public $content; public function mount(Post $post) { $this->title = $post->title; $this->content = $post->content; } // ...};
// resources/views/components/post/⚡edit.blade.php
public function mount(Post $post)
$this->content = $post->content;
You can use dependency injection with all hook methods
Livewire allows you to resolve dependencies out of Laravel's service container by type-hinting method parameters on lifecycle hooks.
The mount() method is a crucial part of using Livewire. The following documentation provides further examples of using the mount() method to accomplish common tasks:
• Initializing properties
• Receiving data from parent components
• Accessing route parameters
As helpful as mount() is, it only runs once per component lifecycle, and you may want to run logic at the beginning of every single request to the server for a given component.
For these cases, Livewire provides a boot() method where you can write component setup code that you intend to run every single time the component class is booted: both on initialization and on subsequent requests.
The boot() method can be useful for things like initializing protected properties, which are not persisted between requests. Below is an example of initializing a protected property as an Eloquent model:
// resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.phpuse Livewire\Attributes\Locked;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Post;new class extends Component { #[Locked] public $postId = 1; protected Post $post; public function boot() { $this->post = Post::find($this->postId); } // ...};
// resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php
use Livewire\Attributes\Locked;
$this->post = Post::find($this->postId);
You can use this technique to have complete control over initializing a component property in your Livewire component.
Most of the time, you can use a computed property instead
The technique used above is powerful; however, it's often better to use Livewire's computed properties to solve this use case.
Always lock sensitive public properties
As you can see above, we are using the #[Locked] attribute on the $postId property. In a scenario like the above, where you want to ensure the $postId property isn't tampered with by users on the client-side, it's important to authorize the property's value before using it or add #[Locked] to the property ensure it is never changed.
For more information, check out the documentation on the Locked attribute.
Client-side users can update public properties in many different ways, most commonly by modifying an input with wire:model on it.
Livewire provides convenient hooks to intercept the updating of a public property so that you can validate or authorize a value before it's set, or ensure a property is set in a given format.
Below is an example of using updating to prevent the modification of the $postId property.
It's worth noting that for this particular example, in an actual application, you should use the #[Locked] attribute instead, like in the above example.
// resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.phpuse Exception;use Livewire\Component;new class extends Component { public $postId = 1; public function updating($property, $value) { // $property: The name of the current property being updated // $value: The value about to be set to the property if ($property === 'postId') { throw new Exception; } } // ...};
// resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php
public function updating($property, $value)
// $property: The name of the current property being updated
// $value: The value about to be set to the property
The above updating() method runs before the property is updated, allowing you to catch invalid input and prevent the property from updating. Below is an example of using updated() to ensure a property's value stays consistent:
// resources/views/components/user/⚡create.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component { public $username = ''; public $email = ''; public function updated($property) { // $property: The name of the current property that was updated if ($property === 'username') { $this->username = strtolower($this->username); } } // ...};
// resources/views/components/user/⚡create.blade.php
public function updated($property)
// $property: The name of the current property that was updated
if ($property === 'username') {
$this->username = strtolower($this->username);
Now, anytime the $username property is updated client-side, we will ensure that the value will always be lowercase.
Because you are often targeting a specific property when using update hooks, Livewire allows you to specify the property name directly as part of the method name. Here's the same example from above but rewritten utilizing this technique:
// resources/views/components/user/⚡create.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component { public $username = ''; public $email = ''; public function updatedUsername() { $this->username = strtolower($this->username); } // ...};
// resources/views/components/user/⚡create.blade.php
public function updatedUsername()
$this->username = strtolower($this->username);
Of course, you can also apply this technique to the updating hook.
Array properties have an additional $key argument passed to these functions to specify the changing element.
Note that when the array itself is updated instead of a specific key, the $key argument is null.
// resources/views/components/preferences/⚡edit.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component { public $preferences = []; public function updatedPreferences($value, $key) { // $value = 'dark' // $key = 'theme' } // ...};
// resources/views/components/preferences/⚡edit.blade.php
public function updatedPreferences($value, $key)
Hydrate & Dehydrate
Hydrate and dehydrate are lesser-known and lesser-utilized hooks. However, there are specific scenarios where they can be powerful.
The terms "dehydrate" and "hydrate" refer to a Livewire component being serialized to JSON for the client-side and then unserialized back into a PHP object on the subsequent request.
We often use the terms "hydrate" and "dehydrate" to refer to this process throughout Livewire's codebase and the documentation. If you'd like more clarity on these terms, you can learn more by consulting our hydration documentation.
Let's look at an example that uses both mount() , hydrate(), and dehydrate() all together to support using a custom data transfer object (DTO) instead of an Eloquent model to store the post data in the component:
// resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component { public $post; public function mount($title, $content) { // Runs at the beginning of the first initial request... $this->post = new PostDto([ 'title' => $title, 'content' => $content, ]); } public function hydrate() { // Runs at the beginning of every "subsequent" request... // This doesn't run on the initial request ("mount" does)... $this->post = new PostDto($this->post); } public function dehydrate() { // Runs at the end of every single request... $this->post = $this->post->toArray(); } // ...};
// resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php
public function mount($title, $content)
// Runs at the beginning of the first initial request...
// Runs at the beginning of every "subsequent" request...
// This doesn't run on the initial request ("mount" does)...
$this->post = new PostDto($this->post);
// Runs at the end of every single request...
$this->post = $this->post->toArray();
Now, from actions and other places inside your component, you can access the PostDto object instead of the primitive data.
The above example mainly demonstrates the abilities and nature of the hydrate() and dehydrate() hooks. However, it is recommended that you use Wireables or Synthesizers to accomplish this instead.
If you want to hook into the process of rendering a component's Blade view, you can do so using the rendering() and rendered() hooks:
// resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Post;new class extends Component { public function render() { return $this->view([ 'post' => Post::all(), ]); } public function rendering($view, $data) { // Runs BEFORE the provided view is rendered... // // $view: The view about to be rendered // $data: The data provided to the view } public function rendered($view, $html) { // Runs AFTER the provided view is rendered... // // $view: The rendered view // $html: The final, rendered HTML } // ...};
// resources/views/components/post/⚡index.blade.php
public function rendering($view, $data)
// Runs BEFORE the provided view is rendered...
// $view: The view about to be rendered
// $data: The data provided to the view
public function rendered($view, $html)
// Runs AFTER the provided view is rendered...
// $html: The final, rendered HTML
Sometimes it can be helpful to intercept and catch errors, eg: to customize the error message or ignore specific type of exceptions. The exception() hook allows you to do just that: you can perform check on the $error, and use the $stopPropagation parameter to catch the issue. This also unlocks powerful patterns when you want to stop further execution of code (return early), this is how internal methods like validate() works.
// resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component { public function mount() { $this->post = Post::find($this->postId); } public function exception($e, $stopPropagation) { if ($e instanceof NotFoundException) { $this->notify('Post is not found'); $stopPropagation(); } } // ...};
// resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php
$this->post = Post::find($this->postId);
public function exception($e, $stopPropagation) {
if ($e instanceof NotFoundException) {
$this->notify('Post is not found');
Using hooks inside a trait
Traits are a helpful way to reuse code across components or extract code from a single component into a dedicated file.
To avoid multiple traits conflicting with each other when declaring lifecycle hook methods, Livewire supports prefixing hook methods with the camelCased name of the current trait declaring them.
This way, you can have multiple traits using the same lifecycle hooks and avoid conflicting method definitions.
Below is an example of a component referencing a trait called HasPostForm:
// resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component { use HasPostForm; // ...};
// resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php
Now here's the actual HasPostForm trait containing all the available prefixed hooks:
trait HasPostForm{ public $title = ''; public $content = ''; public function mountHasPostForm() { // ... } public function hydrateHasPostForm() { // ... } public function bootHasPostForm() { // ... } public function updatingHasPostForm() { // ... } public function updatedHasPostForm() { // ... } public function renderingHasPostForm() { // ... } public function renderedHasPostForm() { // ... } public function dehydrateHasPostForm() { // ... } // ...}
public function mountHasPostForm()
public function hydrateHasPostForm()
public function bootHasPostForm()
public function updatingHasPostForm()
public function updatedHasPostForm()
public function renderingHasPostForm()
public function renderedHasPostForm()
public function dehydrateHasPostForm()
Using hooks inside a form object
Form objects in Livewire support property update hooks. These hooks work similarly to component update hooks, letting you perform actions when properties in the form object change.
Below is an example of a component using a PostForm form object:
// resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component { public PostForm $form; // ...};
// resources/views/components/post/⚡create.blade.php
Here's the PostForm form object containing all the available hooks:
namespace App\Livewire\Forms;use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;use Livewire\Form;class PostForm extends Form{ public $title = ''; public $tags = []; public function updating($property, $value) { // ... } public function updated($property, $value) { // ... } public function updatingTitle($value) { // ... } public function updatedTitle($value) { // ... } public function updatingTags($value, $key) { // ... } public function updatedTags($value, $key) { // ... } // ...}
use Livewire\Attributes\Validate;
public function updating($property, $value)
public function updated($property, $value)
public function updatingTitle($value)
public function updatedTitle($value)
public function updatingTags($value, $key)
public function updatedTags($value, $key)
