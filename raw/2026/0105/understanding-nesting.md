Like many other component-based frameworks, Livewire components are nestable — meaning one component can render multiple components within itself.
However, because Livewire's nesting system is built differently than other frameworks, there are certain implications and constraints that are important to be aware of.
Make sure you understand hydration first
Before learning more about Livewire's nesting system, it's helpful to fully understand how Livewire hydrates components. You can learn more by reading the hydration documentation.
Every component is independent {#every-component-is-an-island}
In Livewire, every component on a page tracks its state and makes updates independently of other components.
For example, consider the following Posts and nested ShowPost components:
namespace App\Livewire;use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;use Livewire\Component;class Posts extends Component{ public $postLimit = 2; public function render() { return view('livewire.posts', [ 'posts' => Auth::user()->posts() ->limit($this->postLimit)->get(), ]); }}
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
return view('livewire.posts', [
'posts' => Auth::user()->posts()
->limit($this->postLimit)->get(),
<div> Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit"> @foreach ($posts as $post) <livewire:show-post :$post :wire:key="$post->id"> @endforeachdiv>
Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit">
<livewire:show-post :$post :wire:key="$post->id">
namespace App\Livewire;use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Post;class ShowPost extends Component{ public Post $post; public function render() { return view('livewire.show-post'); }}
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
class ShowPost extends Component
return view('livewire.show-post');
<div> <h1>{{ $post->title }}h1> <p>{{ $post->content }}p> <button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh postbutton>div>
<button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh postbutton>
Here's what the HTML for the entire component tree might look like on initial page load:
<div wire:id="123" wire:snapshot="..."> Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit"> <div wire:id="456" wire:snapshot="..."> <h1>The first posth1> <p>Post contentp> <button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh postbutton> div> <div wire:id="789" wire:snapshot="..."> <h1>The second posth1> <p>Post contentp> <button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh postbutton> div>div>
<div wire:id="123" wire:snapshot="...">
Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit">
<div wire:id="456" wire:snapshot="...">
<button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh postbutton>
<div wire:id="789" wire:snapshot="...">
<button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh postbutton>
Notice that the parent component contains both its rendered template and the rendered templates of all the components nested within it.
Because each component is independent, they each have their own IDs and snapshots (wire:id and wire:snapshot) embedded in their HTML for Livewire's JavaScript core to extract and track.
Let's consider a few different update scenarios to see the differences in how Livewire handles different levels of nesting.
Updating a child
If you were to click the "Refresh post" button in one of the child show-post components, here is what would be sent to the server:
{ memo: { name: 'show-post', id: '456' }, state: { ... },}
memo: { name: 'show-post', id: '456' },
Here's the HTML that would get sent back:
<div wire:id="456"> <h1>The first posth1> <p>Post contentp> <button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh postbutton>div>
<button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh postbutton>
The important thing to note here is that when an update is triggered on a child component, only that component's data is sent to the server, and only that component is re-rendered.
Now let's look at the less intuitive scenario: updating a parent component.
Updating the parent
As a reminder, here's the Blade template of the parent Posts component:
<div> Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit"> @foreach ($posts as $post) <livewire:show-post :$post :wire:key="$post->id"> @endforeachdiv>
Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit">
<livewire:show-post :$post :wire:key="$post->id">
If a user changes the "Post Limit" value from 2 to 1, an update will be solely triggered on the parent.
Here's an example of what the request payload might look like:
{ updates: { postLimit: 1 }, snapshot: { memo: { name: 'posts', id: '123' }, state: { postLimit: 2, ... }, },}
memo: { name: 'posts', id: '123' },
As you can see, only the snapshot for the parent Posts component is sent along to the server.
An important question you might be asking yourself is: what happens when the parent component re-renders and encounters the child show-post components? How will it re-render the children if their snapshots haven't been included in the request payload?
The answer is: they won't be re-rendered.
When Livewire renders the Posts component, it will render placeholders for any child components it encounters.
Here is an example of what the rendered HTML for the Posts component might be after the above update:
<div wire:id="123"> Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit"> <div wire:id="456">div>div>
Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit">
As you can see, only one child has been rendered because postLimit was updated to 1. However, you will also notice that instead of the full child component, there is only an empty
When this HTML is received on the frontend, Livewire will morph the old HTML for this component into this new HTML, but intelligently skip any child component placeholders.
The effect is that, after morphing, the final DOM content of the parent Posts component will be the following:
<div wire:id="123"> Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit"> <div wire:id="456"> <h1>The first posth1> <p>Post contentp> <button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh postbutton> div>div>
Post Limit: <input type="number" wire:model.live="postLimit">
<button wire:click="$refresh">Refresh postbutton>
Performance implications
Livewire's independent component architecture can have both positive and negative implications for your application.
An advantage of this architecture is it allows you to isolate expensive portions of your application. For example, you can quarantine a slow database query to its own independent component, and its performance overhead won't impact the rest of the page.
However, the biggest drawback of this approach is that because components are entirely separate, inter-component communication/dependencies becomes more difficult.
For example, if you had a property passed down from the above parent Posts component to the nested ShowPost component, it wouldn't be "reactive". Because each component is independent, if a request to the parent component changed the value of the property being passed into ShowPost, it wouldn't update inside ShowPost.
Livewire has overcome a number of these hurdles and provides dedicated APIs for these scenarios like: Reactive properties, Modelable components, and the $parent object.
Armed with this knowledge of how nested Livewire components operate, you will be able to make more informed decisions about when and how to nest components within your application.
