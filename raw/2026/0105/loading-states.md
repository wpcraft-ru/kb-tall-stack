When a user interacts with your Livewire components, providing visual feedback during network requests is essential for a good user experience. Livewire automatically adds a data-loading attribute to any element that triggers a network request, making it easy to style loading states.
Prefer data-loading over wire:loading
Livewire also provides the wire:loading directive for toggling elements during requests. While wire:loading is simpler for basic show/hide scenarios, it has more limitations (requiring wire:target for specificity, doesn't work well with events across components, etc.). For most use cases, you should prefer using data-loading selectors as demonstrated in this guide.
Basic usage
Livewire automatically adds a data-loading attribute to any element that triggers a network request. This allows you to style loading states directly with CSS or Tailwind without using wire:loading directives.
Here's a simple example using a button with wire:click:
<button wire:click="save" class="data-loading:opacity-50"> Save Changesbutton>
<button wire:click="save" class="data-loading:opacity-50">
When the button is clicked and the request is in-flight, it will automatically become semi-transparent thanks to the data-loading attribute being present on the element.
How it works
The data-loading attribute is automatically added to elements that trigger network requests, including:
• Actions: wire:click="save"
• Form submissions: wire:submit="create"
• Property updates: wire:model.live="search"
• Events: wire:click="$dispatch('refresh')"
Importantly, the attribute is added even when dispatching events that are handled by other components:
<button wire:click="$dispatch('refresh-stats')"> Refreshbutton>
<button wire:click="$dispatch('refresh-stats')">
Even though the event is picked up by a different component, the button that dispatched the event will still receive the data-loading attribute during the network request.
Styling with Tailwind
Tailwind v4 and above provides powerful selectors for working with the data-loading attribute.
Basic styling
Use Tailwind's data-loading: variant to apply styles when an element is loading:
<button wire:click="save" class="data-loading:opacity-50"> Savebutton>
<button wire:click="save" class="data-loading:opacity-50">
Showing elements during loading
To show an element only while loading is active, use the not-data-loading:hidden variant:
<button wire:click="save"> Savebutton><span class="not-data-loading:hidden"> Saving...span>
<span class="not-data-loading:hidden">
This approach is preferred over hidden data-loading:block because it works regardless of the element's display type (flex, inline, grid, etc.).
Styling children
You can style child elements when a parent has the data-loading attribute using the in-data-loading: variant:
<button wire:click="save"> <span class="in-data-loading:hidden">Savespan> <span class="not-in-data-loading:hidden">Saving...span>button>
<span class="in-data-loading:hidden">Savespan>
<span class="not-in-data-loading:hidden">Saving...span>
The in-data-loading variant applies to all ancestors
The in-data-loading: variant will trigger if any ancestor element (no matter how far up the tree) has the data-loading attribute. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you have nested loading states.
Styling parents
Style parent elements when they contain a child with data-loading using the has-data-loading: variant:
<div class="has-data-loading:opacity-50"> <button wire:click="save">Savebutton>div>
<div class="has-data-loading:opacity-50">
<button wire:click="save">Savebutton>
When the button is clicked, the entire parent div will become semi-transparent.
Styling siblings
You can style sibling elements using Tailwind's peer utility with the peer-data-loading: variant:
<div> <button wire:click="save" class="peer"> Save button> <span class="peer-data-loading:opacity-50"> Saving... span>div>
<button wire:click="save" class="peer">
<span class="peer-data-loading:opacity-50">
Complex selectors
For more advanced styling needs, you can use arbitrary variants to target specific elements:
<div class="[&[data-loading]>*]:opacity-50" wire:click="save"> <span>Child 1span> <span>Child 2span>div><button class="[&[data-loading]_.icon]:animate-spin" wire:click="save"> <svg class="icon">svg> Savebutton>
<div class="[&[data-loading]>*]:opacity-50" wire:click="save">
<button class="[&[data-loading]_.icon]:animate-spin" wire:click="save">

Advantages over wire:loading
The data-loading attribute approach offers several advantages over the traditional wire:loading directive:
• No targeting needed: Unlike wire:loading which often requires wire:target to specify which action to respond to, the data-loading attribute is automatically scoped to the element that triggered the request.

• More elegant styling: Tailwind's variant system provides a cleaner, more declarative way to style loading states directly in your markup.

Tailwind 4 requirement
Tailwind v4+ required for advanced variants
The in-data-loading:, has-data-loading:, peer-data-loading:, and not-data-loading: variants require Tailwind CSS v4 or above. If you're using an earlier version of Tailwind, you can still target the data-loading attribute using the data-loading: syntax or standard CSS.
Using with plain CSS
If you're not using Tailwind, you can target the data-loading attribute with standard CSS:
[data-loading] { opacity: 0.5;}button[data-loading] { background-color: #ccc;}
You can also use CSS to style child elements:
[data-loading] .loading-text { display: inline;}[data-loading] .default-text { display: none;}
[data-loading] .loading-text {
[data-loading] .default-text {
• wire:loading — Show and hide elements during requests
• Actions — Display feedback during action processing
• Forms — Indicate form submission progress
• Lazy Loading — Show loading states for lazy components
