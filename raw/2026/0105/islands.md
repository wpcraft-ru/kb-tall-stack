Islands allow you to create isolated regions within a Livewire component that update independently. When an action occurs inside an island, only that island re-renders — not the entire component.
This gives you the performance benefits of breaking components into smaller pieces without the overhead of creating separate child components, managing props, or dealing with component communication.
Basic usage
To create an island, wrap any portion of your Blade template with the @island directive:
// resources/views/components/⚡dashboard.blade.phpuse Livewire\Attributes\Computed;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Revenue;new class extends Component { #[Computed] public function revenue() { // Expensive calculation or query... return Revenue::yearToDate(); }};?><div> @island <div> Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }} <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refreshbutton> div> @endisland <div> div>div>
// resources/views/components/⚡dashboard.blade.php
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;
// Expensive calculation or query...
<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refreshbutton>
When the "Refresh" button is clicked, only the island containing the revenue calculation will re-render. The rest of the component remains untouched.
Because the expensive calculation is inside a computed property—which evaluates on-demand—it will only be called when the island re-renders, not when other parts of the page update. However, since islands load with the page by default, the revenue property will still be calculated during the initial page load.
Lazy loading
Sometimes you have expensive computations or slow API calls that shouldn't block your initial page load. You can defer an island's initial render until after the page loads using the lazy parameter:
// resources/views/components/⚡dashboard.blade.phpuse Livewire\Attributes\Computed;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Revenue;new class extends Component { #[Computed] public function revenue() { // Expensive calculation or query... return Revenue::yearToDate(); }};?><div> @island(lazy: true) <div> Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }} <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refreshbutton> div> @endisland <div> div>div>
// resources/views/components/⚡dashboard.blade.php
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;
// Expensive calculation or query...
<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refreshbutton>
The island will display a loading state initially, then fetch and render its content in a separate request.
Lazy vs Deferred loading
By default, lazy uses an intersection observer to trigger the load when the island becomes visible in the viewport. If you want the island to load immediately after the page loads (regardless of visibility), use defer instead:
{{-- Loads when scrolled into view --}}@island(lazy: true) @endisland{{-- Loads immediately after page load --}}@island(defer: true) @endisland
{{-- Loads when scrolled into view --}}
{{-- Loads immediately after page load --}}
Custom loading states
You can customize what displays while a lazy island is loading using the @placeholder directive:
@island(lazy: true) @placeholder <div class="animate-pulse"> <div class="h-32 bg-gray-200 rounded">div> div> @endplaceholder <div> Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }} <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refreshbutton> div>@endisland
<div class="h-32 bg-gray-200 rounded">div>
<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refreshbutton>
Named islands
To trigger an island from elsewhere in your component, give it a name and reference it using wire:island:
<div> @island(name: 'revenue') <div> Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }} div> @endisland <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh" wire:island="revenue"> Refresh revenue button>div>
<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh" wire:island="revenue">
The wire:island directive works alongside action directives like wire:click, wire:submit, etc. to scope their updates to a specific island.
When you have multiple islands with the same name, they're linked together and will always render as a group:
@island(name: 'revenue') <div class="sidebar"> Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }} div>@endisland@island(name: 'revenue') <div class="header"> Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }} div>@endisland<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh" wire:island="revenue"> Refresh revenuebutton>
<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh" wire:island="revenue">
Both islands will update together whenever one is triggered.
Append and prepend modes
Instead of replacing content entirely, islands can append or prepend new content. This is perfect for pagination, infinite scroll, or real-time feeds:
// resources/views/components/⚡activity-feed.blade.phpuse Livewire\Attributes\Computed;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Activity;new class extends Component { public $page = 1; public function loadMore() { $this->page++; } #[Computed] public function activities() { return Activity::latest() ->forPage($this->page, 10) ->get(); }};?><div> @island(name: 'feed') @foreach ($this->activities as $activity) <x-activity-item wire:key="{{ $activity->id }}" :activity="$activity" /> @endforeach @endisland <button type="button" wire:click="loadMore" wire:island.append="feed"> Load more button>div>
// resources/views/components/⚡activity-feed.blade.php
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;
@foreach ($this->activities as $activity)
<x-activity-item wire:key="{{ $activity->id }}" :activity="$activity" />
<button type="button" wire:click="loadMore" wire:island.append="feed">
• wire:island.append - Add to the end
• wire:island.prepend - Add to the beginning
Nested islands
Islands can be nested inside each other. When an outer island re-renders, inner islands are skipped by default:
@island(name: 'revenue') <div> Total revenue: {{ $this->revenue }} @island(name: 'breakdown') <div> Monthly breakdown: {{ $this->monthlyBreakdown }} <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh"> Refresh breakdown button> div> @endisland <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh"> Refresh revenue button> div>@endisland
Total revenue: {{ $this->revenue }}
Monthly breakdown: {{ $this->monthlyBreakdown }}
<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">
<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">
Clicking "Refresh revenue" updates only the outer island, while "Refresh breakdown" updates only the inner island.
Always render with parent
By default, when a component re-renders, islands are skipped. Use the always parameter to force an island to update whenever the parent component updates:
<div> @island(always: true) <div> Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }} <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refresh revenuebutton> div> @endisland <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refreshbutton>div>
<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refresh revenuebutton>
<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refreshbutton>
With always: true, the island will re-render whenever any part of the component updates. This is useful for critical data that should always stay in sync with the component state.
This also works for nested islands — an inner island with always: true will update whenever its parent island updates.
Skip initial render
The skip parameter prevents an island from rendering initially, perfect for on-demand content:
@island(skip: true) @placeholder <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh"> Load revenue details button> @endplaceholder <div> Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }} <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refreshbutton> div>@endisland
<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">
<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refreshbutton>
The placeholder content will be shown initially. When triggered, the island renders and replaces the placeholder.
Island polling
You can use wire:poll within an island to refresh just that island on an interval:
@island(skip: true) <div wire:poll.3s> Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }} <button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refreshbutton> div>@endisland
<button type="button" wire:click="$refresh">Refreshbutton>
The polling is scoped to the island — only the island will refresh every 3 seconds, not the entire component.
Triggering islands from JavaScript
The wire:island directive only works alongside Livewire action directives like wire:click. To scope an action to an island from Alpine or JavaScript, use $wire.$island():
<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.$island('feed').loadMore()"> Load morebutton>
<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.$island('feed').loadMore()">
This is equivalent to wire:click="loadMore" wire:island="feed", but gives you the flexibility of Alpine expressions and JavaScript logic.
Append and prepend modes are supported via an options parameter:
<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.$island('feed', { mode: 'append' }).loadMore()"> Load morebutton>
<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.$island('feed', { mode: 'append' }).loadMore()">
Any $wire method works with $island(), including $refresh(), $set(), and $toggle():
<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.$island('revenue').$refresh()"> Refresh revenuebutton>
<button type="button" x-on:click="$wire.$island('revenue').$refresh()">
Considerations
While islands provide powerful isolation, keep in mind:
Data scope: Islands have access to the component's properties and methods, but not to template variables defined outside the island. Any @php variables or loop variables from the parent template won't be available inside the island:
@php $localVariable = 'This won\'t be available in the island';@endphp@island {{-- ❌ This will error - $localVariable is not accessible --}} {{ $localVariable }} {{-- ✅ Component properties work fine --}} {{ $this->revenue }}@endisland
$localVariable = 'This won\'t be available in the island';
{{-- ❌ This will error - $localVariable is not accessible --}}
{{-- ✅ Component properties work fine --}}
Islands can't be used in loops or conditionals: Because islands don't have access to loop variables or conditional context, they cannot be used inside @foreach, @if, or other control structures:
{{-- ❌ This won't work --}}@foreach ($items as $item) @island {{ $item->name }} @endisland@endforeach{{-- ❌ This won't work either --}}@if ($showRevenue) @island Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }} @endisland@endif{{-- ✅ Instead, put the loop/conditional inside the island --}}@island @if ($this->showRevenue) Revenue: {{ $this->revenue }} @endif @foreach ($this->items as $item) {{ $item->name }} @endforeach@endisland
{{-- ❌ This won't work either --}}
{{-- ✅ Instead, put the loop/conditional inside the island --}}
@foreach ($this->items as $item)
State synchronization: Although island requests run in parallel, both islands and the root component can mutate the same component state. If multiple requests are in flight simultaneously, there can be divergent state — the last response to return will win the state battle.
When to use islands: Islands are most beneficial for:
• Expensive computations that shouldn't block initial page load
• Independent regions with their own interactions
• Real-time updates affecting only portions of the UI
• Performance bottlenecks in large components
Islands aren't necessary for static content, tightly coupled UI, or simple components that already render quickly.
• Nesting — Alternative approach using child components
• Lazy Loading — Defer loading of expensive content
• Computed Properties — Optimize island performance with memoization
• @island — Create isolated update regions
