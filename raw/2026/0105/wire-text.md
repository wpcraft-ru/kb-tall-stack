wire:text is a directive that dynamically updates an element's text content based on a component property or expression. Unlike using Blade's {{ }} syntax, wire:text updates the content without requiring a network roundtrip to re-render the component.
If you are familiar with Alpine's x-text directive, the two are essentially the same.
Basic usage
Here's an example of using wire:text to optimistically show updates to a Livewire property without waiting for a network roundtrip.
use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Post;class ShowPost extends Component{ public Post $post; public $likes; public function mount() { $this->likes = $this->post->like_count; } public function like() { $this->post->like(); $this->likes = $this->post->fresh()->like_count; }}
class ShowPost extends Component
$this->likes = $this->post->like_count;
$this->likes = $this->post->fresh()->like_count;
<div> <button x-on:click="$wire.likes++" wire:click="like">❤️ Likebutton> Likes: <span wire:text="likes">span>div>
<button x-on:click="$wire.likes++" wire:click="like">❤️ Likebutton>
Likes: <span wire:text="likes">span>
When the button is clicked, $wire.likes++ immediately updates the displayed count through wire:text, while wire:click="like" persists the change to the database in the background.
This pattern makes wire:text perfect for building optimistic UIs in Livewire.
This directive has no modifiers.
