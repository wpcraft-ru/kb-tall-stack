Master everything new in Livewire v4
Livewire allows you to teleport part of your template to another part of the DOM on the page entirely.
This is useful for things like nested dialogs. When nesting one dialog inside of another, the z-index of the parent modal is applied to the nested modal. This can cause problems with styling backdrops and overlays. To avoid this problem, you can use Livewire's @teleport directive to render each nested modal as siblings in the rendered DOM.
This functionality is powered by Alpine's x-teleport directive.
Basic usage
To teleport a portion of your template to another part of the DOM, you can wrap it in Livewire's @teleport directive.
Below is an example of using @teleport to render a modal dialog's contents at the end of the element on the page:
<div> <div x-data="{ open: false }"> <button @click="open = ! open">Toggle Modalbutton> @teleport('body') <div x-show="open"> Modal contents... div> @endteleport div>div>
<div x-data="{ open: false }">
<button @click="open = ! open">Toggle Modalbutton>
The @teleport selector can be any string you would normally pass into something like document.querySelector().
You can learn more about document.querySelector() by consulting its MDN documentation.
Now, when the above Livewire template is rendered on the page, the contents portion of the modal will be rendered at the end of :
<body> <div x-show="open"> Modal contents... div>body>
You must teleport outside the component
Livewire only supports teleporting HTML outside your components. For example, teleporting a modal to the tag is fine, but teleporting it to another element within your component will not work.
Teleporting only works with a single root element
Make sure you only include a single root element inside your @teleport statement.
