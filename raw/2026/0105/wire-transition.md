wire:transition enables smooth animations when elements appear, disappear, or change using the browser's native View Transitions API.
Unlike JavaScript-based animation libraries, View Transitions are hardware-accelerated and handled natively by the browser, resulting in smoother animations with less overhead.
Basic usage
Add wire:transition to any element that may be added, removed, or changed during a Livewire update:
class ShowPost extends Component{ public Post $post; public $showComments = false;}
class ShowPost extends Component
<div> <button wire:click="$toggle('showComments')">Toggle commentsbutton> @if ($showComments) <div wire:transition> @foreach ($post->comments as $comment) <div>{{ $comment->body }}div> @endforeach div> @endifdiv>
<button wire:click="$toggle('showComments')">Toggle commentsbutton>
@foreach ($post->comments as $comment)
When the comments appear or disappear, the browser will smoothly crossfade them instead of abruptly showing or hiding them.
Named transitions
By default, Livewire assigns the view-transition-name match-element to elements with wire:transition. You can provide a custom name to enable more advanced transition effects:
<div wire:transition="sidebar">...div>
<div wire:transition="sidebar">...div>
This sets the element's view-transition-name CSS property to sidebar, which you can target with CSS for custom animations.
Customizing animations with CSS
View Transitions are controlled entirely through CSS. You can customize the animation by targeting the view-transition pseudo-elements:
/* Customize the transition for a specific element */::view-transition-old(sidebar) { animation: 300ms ease-out both slide-out;}::view-transition-new(sidebar) { animation: 300ms ease-in both slide-in;}@keyframes slide-out { to { transform: translateX(-100%); }}@keyframes slide-in { from { transform: translateX(100%); }}
/* Customize the transition for a specific element */
::view-transition-old(sidebar) {
animation: 300ms ease-out both slide-out;
::view-transition-new(sidebar) {
animation: 300ms ease-in both slide-in;
to { transform: translateX(-100%); }
from { transform: translateX(100%); }
The View Transitions API provides three pseudo-elements you can style:
• ::view-transition-old(name) — The outgoing element's snapshot
• ::view-transition-new(name) — The incoming element's snapshot
• ::view-transition-group(name) — Container for both snapshots
Transition types
For more complex scenarios like step wizards where you need different animations based on direction, you can use transition types. This allows you to animate "forward" and "backward" differently.
Use the $this->transition() method to set a transition type:
class Wizard extends Component{ public $step = 1; public function goToStep($step) { $this->transition(type: $step > $this->step ? 'forward' : 'backward'); $this->step = $step; }}
class Wizard extends Component
public function goToStep($step)
$this->transition(type: $step > $this->step ? 'forward' : 'backward');
Then target the type in your CSS using the :active-view-transition-type() selector:
html:active-view-transition-type(forward) { &::view-transition-old(content) { animation: 300ms ease-out both slide-out-left; } &::view-transition-new(content) { animation: 300ms ease-in both slide-in-right; }}html:active-view-transition-type(backward) { &::view-transition-old(content) { animation: 300ms ease-out both slide-out-right; } &::view-transition-new(content) { animation: 300ms ease-in both slide-in-left; }}@keyframes slide-out-left { from { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; } to { transform: translateX(-100%); opacity: 0; }}@keyframes slide-in-right { from { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; } to { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; }}@keyframes slide-out-right { from { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; } to { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; }}@keyframes slide-in-left { from { transform: translateX(-100%); opacity: 0; } to { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; }}
html:active-view-transition-type(forward) {
&::view-transition-old(content) {
animation: 300ms ease-out both slide-out-left;
&::view-transition-new(content) {
animation: 300ms ease-in both slide-in-right;
html:active-view-transition-type(backward) {
&::view-transition-old(content) {
animation: 300ms ease-out both slide-out-right;
&::view-transition-new(content) {
animation: 300ms ease-in both slide-in-left;
from { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; }
to { transform: translateX(-100%); opacity: 0; }
from { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; }
to { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; }
from { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; }
to { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; }
from { transform: translateX(-100%); opacity: 0; }
to { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; }
For methods that always transition in the same direction, you can use the #[Transition] attribute instead:
use Livewire\Attributes\Transition;class Wizard extends Component{ public $step = 1; #[Transition(type: 'forward')] public function next() { $this->step++; } #[Transition(type: 'backward')] public function previous() { $this->step--; }}
use Livewire\Attributes\Transition;
class Wizard extends Component
#[Transition(type: 'forward')]
#[Transition(type: 'backward')]
Skipping transitions
Sometimes you may want to disable transitions for specific actions—for example, a "reset" button that should instantly jump to the first step without animation.
Use $this->skipTransition() to disable transitions for the current request:
public function reset(){ $this->skipTransition(); $this->step = 1;}
Or use the #[Transition] attribute with skip: true:
use Livewire\Attributes\Transition;#[Transition(skip: true)]public function reset(){ $this->step = 1;}
use Livewire\Attributes\Transition;
Respecting reduced motion
Livewire automatically respects the user's prefers-reduced-motion setting. When enabled, transitions are disabled to avoid causing discomfort for users who are sensitive to motion.
Browser support
View Transitions are supported in Chrome 111+, Edge 111+, and Safari 18+. In browsers that don't support View Transitions, elements will appear and disappear without animation—the functionality still works, just without the visual transition.
Firefox 144+ supports basic view transitions, but does not support transition types.
