Livewire allows you to nest additional Livewire components inside of a parent component. This feature is immensely powerful, as it allows you to re-use and encapsulate behavior within Livewire components that are shared across your application.
You might not need a Livewire component
Before you extract a portion of your template into a nested Livewire component, ask yourself: Does this content in this component need to be "live"? If not, we recommend that you create a simple Blade component instead. Only create a Livewire component if the component benefits from Livewire's dynamic nature or if there is a direct performance benefit.
Consider islands for isolated updates
If you want to isolate re-rendering to specific regions of your component without the overhead of creating separate child components, consider using islands instead. Islands let you create independently-updating regions within a single component without managing props, events, or child component communication.
Consult our in-depth, technical examination of Livewire component nesting for more information on the performance, usage implications, and constraints of nested Livewire components.
Nesting a component
To nest a Livewire component within a parent component, simply include it in the parent component's Blade view. Below is an example of a dashboard parent component that contains a nested todos component:
// resources/views/components/⚡dashboard.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component { //};?><div> <h1>Dashboardh1> <livewire:todos /> div>
// resources/views/components/⚡dashboard.blade.php
On this page's initial render, the dashboard component will encounter and render it in place. On a subsequent network request to dashboard, the nested todos component will skip rendering because it is now its own independent component on the page. For more information on the technical concepts behind nesting and rendering, consult our documentation on why nested components are independent.
For more information about the syntax for rendering components, consult our documentation on Rendering Components.
Passing props to children
Passing data from a parent component to a child component is straightforward. In fact, it's very much like passing props to a typical Blade component.
For example, let's check out a todos component that passes a collection of $todos to a child component called todo-count:
// resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.phpuse Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;use Livewire\Component;new class extends Component { #[Computed] public function todos() { return Auth::user()->todos, }};?><div> <livewire:todo-count :todos="$this->todos" /> div>
// resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;
<livewire:todo-count :todos="$this->todos" />
As you can see, we are passing $this->todos into todo-count with the syntax: :todos="$this->todos".
Now that $todos has been passed to the child component, you can receive that data through the child component's mount() method:
// resources/views/components/⚡todo-count.blade.phpuse Livewire\Attributes\Computed;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Todo;new class extends Component { public $todos; public function mount($todos) { $this->todos = $todos; } #[Computed] public function count() { return $this->todos->count(), }};?><div> Count: {{ $this->count }}div>
// resources/views/components/⚡todo-count.blade.php
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;
Omitmount() as a shorter alternative
If the mount() method in above example feels like redundant boilerplate code to you, it can be omitted as long as the property and parameter names match:
Passing static props
In the previous example, we passed props to our child component using Livewire's dynamic prop syntax, which supports PHP expressions like so:
<livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" />
<livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" />
However, sometimes you may want to pass a component a simple static value such as a string. In these cases, you may omit the colon from the beginning of the statement:
<livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" label="Todo Count:" />
<livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" label="Todo Count:" />
Boolean values may be provided to components by only specifying the key. For example, to pass an $inline variable with a value of true to a component, we may simply place inline on the component tag:
<livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" inline />
<livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" inline />
Shortened attribute syntax
When passing PHP variables into a component, the variable name and the prop name are often the same. To avoid writing the name twice, Livewire allows you to simply prefix the variable with a colon:
-<livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" /> +<livewire:todo-count :$todos />
-<livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" />
+<livewire:todo-count :$todos />
Rendering children in a loop
When rendering a child component within a loop, you should include a unique key value for each iteration.
Component keys are how Livewire tracks each component on subsequent renders, particularly if a component has already been rendered or if multiple components have been re-arranged on the page.
You can specify the component's key by specifying a :key prop on the child component:
<div> <h1>Todosh1> @foreach ($todos as $todo) <livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" /> @endforeachdiv>
<livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" />
As you can see, each child component will have a unique key set to the ID of each $todo. This ensures the key will be unique and tracked if the todos are re-ordered.
If you have used frontend frameworks like Vue or Alpine, you are familiar with adding a key to a nested element in a loop. However, in those frameworks, a key isn't mandatory, meaning the items will render, but a re-order might not be tracked properly. However, Livewire relies more heavily on keys and will behave incorrectly without them.
Reactive props
Developers new to Livewire expect that props are "reactive" by default. In other words, they expect that when a parent changes the value of a prop being passed into a child component, the child component will automatically be updated. However, by default, Livewire props are not reactive.
When using Livewire, every component is independent. This means that when an update is triggered on the parent and a network request is dispatched, only the parent component's state is sent to the server to re-render - not the child component's. The intention behind this behavior is to only send the minimal amount of data back and forth between the server and client, making updates as performant as possible.
But, if you want or need a prop to be reactive, you can easily enable this behavior using the #[Reactive] attribute parameter.
For example, below is the template of a parent todos component. Inside, it is rendering a todo-count component and passing in the current list of todos:
<div> <h1>Todos:h1> <livewire:todo-count :$todos /> div>
<livewire:todo-count :$todos />
Now let's add #[Reactive] to the $todos prop in the todo-count component. Once we have done so, any todos that are added or removed inside the parent component will automatically trigger an update within the todo-count component:
// resources/views/components/⚡todo-count.blade.phpuse Livewire\Attributes\Reactive;use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Todo;new class extends Component { #[Reactive] public $todos; #[Computed] public function count() { return $this->todos->count(), }};?><div> Count: {{ $this->count }}div>
// resources/views/components/⚡todo-count.blade.php
use Livewire\Attributes\Reactive;
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;
Reactive properties are an incredibly powerful feature, making Livewire more similar to frontend component libraries like Vue and React. But, it is important to understand the performance implications of this feature and only add #[Reactive] when it makes sense for your particular scenario.
Islands can eliminate the need for reactive props
If you find yourself creating child components primarily to isolate updates and using #[Reactive] to keep them in sync, consider using islands instead. Islands provide isolated re-rendering within a single component without the need for reactive props or child component communication.
Binding to child data using wire:model
Another powerful pattern for sharing state between parent and child components is using wire:model directly on a child component via Livewire's Modelable feature.
This behavior is very commonly needed when extracting an input element into a dedicated Livewire component while still accessing its state in the parent component.
Below is an example of a parent todos component that contains a $todo property which tracks the current todo about to be added by a user:
// resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.phpuse Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Todo;new class extends Component { public $todo = ''; public function add() { Todo::create([ 'content' => $this->pull('todo'), ]); } #[Computed] public function todos() { return Auth::user()->todos, }};
// resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;
'content' => $this->pull('todo'),
As you can see in the todos template, wire:model is being used to bind the $todo property directly to a nested todo-input component:
<div> <h1>Todosh1> <livewire:todo-input wire:model="todo" /> <button wire:click="add">Add Todobutton> <div> @foreach ($this->todos as $todo) <livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" /> @endforeach div>div>
<livewire:todo-input wire:model="todo" />
<button wire:click="add">Add Todobutton>
@foreach ($this->todos as $todo)
<livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" />
Livewire provides a #[Modelable] attribute you can add to any child component property to make it modelable from a parent component.
Below is the todo-input component with the #[Modelable] attribute added above the $value property to signal to Livewire that if wire:model is declared on the component by a parent it should bind to this property:
// resources/views/components/⚡todo-input.blade.phpuse Livewire\Attributes\Modelable;use Livewire\Component;new class extends Component { #[Modelable] public $value = '';};?><div> <input type="text" wire:model="value" >div>
// resources/views/components/⚡todo-input.blade.php
use Livewire\Attributes\Modelable;
<input type="text" wire:model="value" >
Now the parent todos component can treat todo-input like any other input element and bind directly to its value using wire:model.
Currently Livewire only supports a single #[Modelable] attribute, so only the first one will be bound.
Slots allow you to pass Blade content from a parent component into a child component. This is useful when a child component needs to render its own content while also allowing the parent to inject custom content in specific places.
Below is an example of a parent component that renders a list of comments. Each comment is rendered by a Comment child component, but the parent passes in a "Remove" button via a slot:
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Post;new class extends Component { public Post $post; #[Computed] public function comments() { return $this->post->comments; } public function removeComment($id) { $this->post->comments()->find($id)->delete(); }};?><div> @foreach ($this->comments as $comment) <livewire:comment :$comment :wire:key="$comment->id"> <button wire:click="removeComment({{ $comment->id }})"> Remove button> livewire:comment> @endforeachdiv>
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;
public function removeComment($id)
$this->post->comments()->find($id)->delete();
@foreach ($this->comments as $comment)
<livewire:comment :$comment :wire:key="$comment->id">
<button wire:click="removeComment({{ $comment->id }})">
Now that content has been passed to the Comment child component, you can render it using the $slot variable:
use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Comment;new class extends Component { public Comment $comment;};?><div> <p>{{ $comment->author }}p> <p>{{ $comment->body }}p> {{ $slot }}div>
When the Comment component renders $slot, Livewire will inject the content passed from the parent.
It's important to understand that slots are evaluated in the context of the parent component. This means any properties or methods referenced inside the slot belong to the parent, not the child. In the example above, the removeComment() method is called on the parent component, not the Comment child.
Named slots
In addition to the default slot, you may also pass multiple named slots into a child component. This is useful when you want to provide content for multiple areas of a child component.
Below is an example of passing both a default slot and a named actions slot to the Comment component:
<div> @foreach ($this->comments as $comment) <livewire:comment :$comment :wire:key="$comment->id"> <livewire:slot name="actions"> <button wire:click="removeComment({{ $comment->id }})"> Remove button> livewire:slot> <span>Posted on {{ $comment->created_at }}span> livewire:comment> @endforeachdiv>
@foreach ($this->comments as $comment)
<livewire:comment :$comment :wire:key="$comment->id">
<livewire:slot name="actions">
<button wire:click="removeComment({{ $comment->id }})">
<span>Posted on {{ $comment->created_at }}span>
You can access named slots in the child component by passing the slot name to the $slots variable:
<div> <p>{{ $comment->author }}p> <p>{{ $comment->body }}p> <div class="actions"> {{ $slots['actions'] }} div> <div class="metadata"> {{ $slot }} div>div>
Checking if a slot was provided
You can check if a slot was provided by the parent using the has() method on the $slots variable. This is helpful when you want to conditionally render content based on whether or not a slot is present:
<div> <p>{{ $comment->author }}p> <p>{{ $comment->body }}p> @if ($slots->has('actions')) <div class="actions"> {{ $slots['actions'] }} div> @endif {{ $slot }}div>
Forwarding HTML attributes
Like Blade components, Livewire components support forwarding HTML attributes from a parent to a child using the $attributes variable.
Below is an example of a parent component passing a class attribute to a child component:
<livewire:comment :$comment class="border-b" />
<livewire:comment :$comment class="border-b" />
You can apply these attributes in the child component using the $attributes variable:
<div {{ $attributes->class('bg-white rounded-md') }}> <p>{{ $comment->author }}p> <p>{{ $comment->body }}p>div>
<div {{ $attributes->class('bg-white rounded-md') }}>
Attributes that match public property names are automatically passed as props and excluded from $attributes. Any remaining attributes like class, id, or data-* are available through $attributes.
Islands vs nested components
When building Livewire applications, you'll often face a choice: Should you create a nested child component or use an island? Both approaches allow you to isolate updates to specific regions, but they serve different purposes.
When to use islands
Islands are ideal when you want performance isolation without architectural complexity. Use islands when:
You need performance optimization without the overhead
If your primary goal is to prevent expensive computations from running unnecessarily, islands are the simpler solution:
{{-- Island: Simple performance isolation --}}@island <div> Revenue: {{ $this->expensiveRevenue }} <button wire:click="$refresh">Refreshbutton> div>@endisland
{{-- Island: Simple performance isolation --}}
Revenue: {{ $this->expensiveRevenue }}
<button wire:click="$refresh">Refreshbutton>
This achieves the same performance benefit as a child component, but without creating a separate component file, managing props, or setting up event communication.
You want to defer or lazy load content
Islands excel at deferring expensive operations until after the initial page load:
@island(lazy: true) <div>{{ $this->slowApiCall }}div>@endisland
<div>{{ $this->slowApiCall }}div>
You have multiple independent UI regions
When you have several regions that update independently but don't need separate logic:
@island(name: 'stats') <div>Stats: {{ $this->stats }}div>@endisland@island(name: 'chart') <div>Chart: {{ $this->chartData }}div>@endisland
<div>Stats: {{ $this->stats }}div>
<div>Chart: {{ $this->chartData }}div>
The isolated region doesn't need its own lifecycle
Islands share the parent component's lifecycle, state, and methods. This is perfect when the region is conceptually part of the same component.
When to use nested components
Nested components are better when you need true encapsulation and reusability. Use nested components when:
You need reusable, self-contained functionality
If the component will be used in multiple places with its own logic and state:
{{-- This todo-item can be reused across the application --}}<livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" />
{{-- This todo-item can be reused across the application --}}
<livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" />
You need separate lifecycle hooks
When the child needs its own mount(), updated(), or other lifecycle methods:
public function mount($todo){ $this->authorize('view', $todo);}public function updated($property){ // Child-specific update logic}
$this->authorize('view', $todo);
public function updated($property)
// Child-specific update logic
You need encapsulated state and logic
When the child has complex state management that should be isolated:
// Child component with its own encapsulated statepublic $editMode = false;public $draft = '';public function startEdit() { /* ... */ }public function saveEdit() { /* ... */ }public function cancelEdit() { /* ... */ }
// Child component with its own encapsulated state
public function startEdit() { /* ... */ }
public function saveEdit() { /* ... */ }
public function cancelEdit() { /* ... */ }
You need the component to be truly independent
Nested components are truly independent, maintaining their own state across parent updates. This is valuable when you don't want parent re-renders to affect the child.
You're building a component library
When creating reusable components for your team or organization, nested components provide the proper encapsulation boundaries.
Quick decision guide
• "Does this need to be reusable?" → Nested component
• "Does this need its own lifecycle methods?" → Nested component
• "Am I just trying to optimize performance?" → Island
• "Do I want to defer loading expensive content?" → Island (with lazy or defer)
• "Will this be used in one place only?" → Probably an island
• "Does this need complex, isolated state?" → Nested component
Remember: You can always start with an island for simplicity and refactor to a nested component later if you need the additional encapsulation.
Listening for events from children
Another powerful parent-child component communication technique is Livewire's event system, which allows you to dispatch an event on the server or client that can be intercepted by other components.
Our complete documentation on Livewire's event system provides more detailed information on events, but below we'll discuss a simple example of using an event to trigger an update in a parent component.
Consider a todos component with functionality to show and remove todos:
// resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.phpuse Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Todo;new class extends Component { public function remove($todoId) { $todo = Todo::find($todoId); $this->authorize('delete', $todo); $todo->delete(); } #[Computed] public function todos() { return Auth::user()->todos, }};?><div> @foreach ($this->todos as $todo) <livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" /> @endforeachdiv>
// resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;
public function remove($todoId)
$this->authorize('delete', $todo);
@foreach ($this->todos as $todo)
<livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" />
To call remove() from inside the child todo-item components, you can add an event listener to todos via the #[On] attribute:
// resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.phpuse Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;use Livewire\Attributes\On;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Todo;new class extends Component { #[On('remove-todo')] public function remove($todoId) { $todo = Todo::find($todoId); $this->authorize('delete', $todo); $todo->delete(); } #[Computed] public function todos() { return Auth::user()->todos, }};?><div> @foreach ($this->todos as $todo) <livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" /> @endforeachdiv>
// resources/views/components/⚡todos.blade.php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;
public function remove($todoId)
$this->authorize('delete', $todo);
@foreach ($this->todos as $todo)
<livewire:todo-item :$todo :wire:key="$todo->id" />
Once the attribute has been added to the action, you can dispatch the remove-todo event from the todo-item child component:
// resources/views/components/⚡todo-item.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Todo;new class extends Component { public Todo $todo; public function remove() { $this->dispatch('remove-todo', todoId: $this->todo->id); }};?><div> <span>{{ $todo->content }}span> <button wire:click="remove">Removebutton>div>
// resources/views/components/⚡todo-item.blade.php
$this->dispatch('remove-todo', todoId: $this->todo->id);
<span>{{ $todo->content }}span>
<button wire:click="remove">Removebutton>
Now when the "Remove" button is clicked inside a todo-item, the parent todos component will intercept the dispatched event and perform the todo removal.
After the todo is removed in the parent, the list will be re-rendered and the child that dispatched the remove-todo event will be removed from the page.
Improving performance by dispatching client-side
Though the above example works, it takes two network requests to perform a single action:
• The first network request from the todo-item component triggers the remove action, dispatching the remove-todo event.
• The second network request is after the remove-todo event is dispatched client-side and is intercepted by todos to call its remove action.
You can avoid the first request entirely by dispatching the remove-todo event directly on the client-side. Below is an updated todo-item component that does not trigger a network request when dispatching the remove-todo event:
// resources/views/components/⚡todo-item.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Todo;new class extends Component { public Todo $todo;};?><div> <span>{{ $todo->content }}span> <button wire:click="$dispatch('remove-todo', { todoId: {{ $todo->id }} })">Removebutton>div>
// resources/views/components/⚡todo-item.blade.php
<span>{{ $todo->content }}span>
<button wire:click="$dispatch('remove-todo', { todoId: {{ $todo->id }} })">Removebutton>
As a rule of thumb, always prefer dispatching client-side when possible.
Islands eliminate event communication overhead
If you're creating child components primarily to trigger parent updates via events, consider using islands instead. Islands can call component methods directly without the indirection of events, since they share the same component context.
Directly accessing the parent from the child
Event communication adds a layer of indirection. A parent can listen for an event that never gets dispatched from a child, and a child can dispatch an event that is never intercepted by a parent.
This indirection is sometimes desirable; however, in other cases you may prefer to access a parent component directly from the child component.
Livewire allows you to accomplish this by providing a magic $parent variable to your Blade template that you can use to access actions and properties directly from the child. Here's the above TodoItem template rewritten to call the remove() action directly on the parent via the magic $parent variable:
<div> <span>{{ $todo->content }}span> <button wire:click="$parent.remove({{ $todo->id }})">Removebutton>div>
<span>{{ $todo->content }}span>
<button wire:click="$parent.remove({{ $todo->id }})">Removebutton>
Events and direct parent communication are a few of the ways to communicate back and forth between parent and child components. Understanding their tradeoffs enables you to make more informed decisions about which pattern to use in a particular scenario.
Dynamic child components
Sometimes, you may not know which child component should be rendered on a page until run-time. Therefore, Livewire allows you to choose a child component at run-time via , which receives an :is prop:
<livewire:dynamic-component :is="$current" />
<livewire:dynamic-component :is="$current" />
Dynamic child components are useful in a variety of different scenarios, but below is an example of rendering different steps in a multi-step form using a dynamic component:
// resources/views/components/⚡steps.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component { public $current = 'step-one'; protected $steps = [ 'step-one', 'step-two', 'step-three', ]; public function next() { $currentIndex = array_search($this->current, $this->steps); $this->current = $this->steps[$currentIndex + 1]; }};?><div> <livewire:dynamic-component :is="$current" :wire:key="$current" /> <button wire:click="next">Nextbutton>div>
// resources/views/components/⚡steps.blade.php
$currentIndex = array_search($this->current, $this->steps);
$this->current = $this->steps[$currentIndex + 1];
<livewire:dynamic-component :is="$current" :wire:key="$current" />
<button wire:click="next">Nextbutton>
Now, if the steps component's $current prop is set to "step-one", Livewire will render a component named "step-one" like so:
// resources/views/components/⚡step-one.blade.phpuse Livewire\Component;new class extends Component { //};?><div> Step One Contentdiv>
// resources/views/components/⚡step-one.blade.php
If you prefer, you can use the alternative syntax:
<livewire:is :component="$current" :wire:key="$current" />
<livewire:is :component="$current" :wire:key="$current" />
Don't forget to assign each child component a unique key. Although Livewire automatically generates a key for and , that same key will apply to all your child components, meaning subsequent renders will be skipped.
See forcing a child component to re-render for a deeper understanding of how keys affect component rendering.
Recursive components
Although rarely needed by most applications, Livewire components may be nested recursively, meaning a parent component renders itself as its child.
Imagine a survey which contains a survey-question component that can have sub-questions attached to itself:
// resources/views/components/⚡survey-question.blade.phpuse Livewire\Attributes\Computed;use Livewire\Component;use App\Models\Question;new class extends Component { public Question $question; #[Computed] public function subQuestions() { return $this->question->subQuestions, }};?><div> Question: {{ $question->content }} @foreach ($this->subQuestions as $subQuestion) <livewire:survey-question :question="$subQuestion" :wire:key="$subQuestion->id" /> @endforeachdiv>
// resources/views/components/⚡survey-question.blade.php
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;
public function subQuestions()
return $this->question->subQuestions,
Question: {{ $question->content }}
@foreach ($this->subQuestions as $subQuestion)
<livewire:survey-question :question="$subQuestion" :wire:key="$subQuestion->id" />
Of course, the standard rules of recursion apply to recursive components. Most importantly, you should have logic in your template to ensure the template doesn't recurse indefinitely. In the example above, if a $subQuestion contained the original question as its own $subQuestion, an infinite loop would occur.
Forcing a child component to re-render
Behind the scenes, Livewire generates a key for each nested Livewire component in its template.
For example, consider the following nested todo-count component:
<div> <livewire:todo-count :$todos />div>
<livewire:todo-count :$todos />
Livewire internally attaches a random string key to the component like so:
<div> <livewire:todo-count :$todos wire:key="lska" />div>
<livewire:todo-count :$todos wire:key="lska" />
When the parent component is rendering and encounters a child component like the above, it stores the key in a list of children attached to the parent:
Livewire uses this list for reference on subsequent renders in order to detect if a child component has already been rendered in a previous request. If it has already been rendered, the component is skipped. Remember, nested components are independent. However, if the child key is not in the list, meaning it hasn't been rendered already, Livewire will create a new instance of the component and render it in place.
These nuances are all behind-the-scenes behavior that most users don't need to be aware of; however, the concept of setting a key on a child is a powerful tool for controlling child rendering.
Using this knowledge, if you want to force a component to re-render, you can simply change its key.
Below is an example where we might want to destroy and re-initialize the todo-count component if the $todos being passed to the component are changed:
<div> <livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" :wire:key="$todos->pluck('id')->join('-')" />div>
<livewire:todo-count :todos="$todos" :wire:key="$todos->pluck('id')->join('-')" />
As you can see above, we are generating a dynamic :key string based on the content of $todos. This way, the todo-count component will render and exist as normal until the $todos themselves change. At that point, the component will be re-initialized entirely from scratch, and the old component will be discarded.
