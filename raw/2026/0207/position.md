Utilities for controlling how an element is positioned in the document.
Statically positioning elements
Use the static utility to position an element according to the normal flow of the document:
<div class="static ..."> <p>Static parentp> <div class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 ..."> <p>Absolute childp> div>div>
With statically positioned elements, any offsets will be ignored and the element will not act as a position reference for absolutely positioned children.
Relatively positioning elements
Use the relative utility to position an element according to the normal flow of the document:
<div class="relative ..."> <p>Relative parentp> <div class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 ..."> <p>Absolute childp> div>div>
With relatively position elements, any offsets are calculated relative to the element's normal position and the element will act as a position reference for absolutely positioned children.
Absolutely positioning elements
Use the absolute utility to position an element outside of the normal flow of the document, causing neighboring elements to act as if the element doesn't exist:
<div class="static ..."> <div class="static ..."><p>Static childp>div> <div class="inline-block ..."><p>Static siblingp>div> <div class="absolute ..."><p>Absolute childp>div> <div class="inline-block ..."><p>Static siblingp>div>div>
With absolutely positioned elements, any offsets are calculated relative to the nearest parent that has a position other than static, and the element will act as a position reference for other absolutely positioned children.
Fixed positioning elements
Use the fixed utility to position an element relative to the browser window:
Scroll this element to see the fixed positioning in action
<div class="relative"> <div class="fixed top-0 right-0 left-0">Contactsdiv> <div> <div> <img src="/img/andrew.jpg" /> <strong>Andrew Alfredstrong> div> <div> <img src="/img/debra.jpg" /> <strong>Debra Houstonstrong> div> div>div>
With fixed positioned elements, any offsets are calculated relative to the viewport and the element will act as a position reference for absolutely positioned children:
Sticky positioning elements
Use the sticky utility to position an element as relative until it crosses a specified threshold, then treat it as fixed until its parent is off screen:
Scroll this element to see the sticky positioning in action
<div> <div> <div class="sticky top-0 ...">Adiv> <div> <div> <img src="/img/andrew.jpg" /> <strong>Andrew Alfredstrong> div> <div> <img src="/img/aisha.jpg" /> <strong>Aisha Houstonstrong> div> div> div> <div> <div class="sticky top-0">Bdiv> <div> <div> <img src="/img/bob.jpg" /> <strong>Bob Alfredstrong> div> div> div> div>
With sticky positioned elements, any offsets are calculated relative to the element's normal position and the element will act as a position reference for absolutely positioned children.
Responsive design
Prefix a position utility with a breakpoint variant like md: to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
<div class="relative md:absolute ..."> div>
Learn more about using variants in the variants documentation.
