Using utilities to style elements on hover, focus, and more.
Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally by adding a variant to the beginning of the class name that describes the condition you want to target.
For example, to apply the bg-sky-700 class on hover, use the hover:bg-sky-700 class:
Hover over this button to see the background color change
<button class="bg-sky-500 hover:bg-sky-700 ...">Save changesbutton>
When writing CSS the traditional way, a single class name would do different things based on the current state:
Traditionally the same class name applies different styles on hover
.btn-primary { background-color: #0ea5e9;}.btn-primary:hover { background-color: #0369a1;}
In Tailwind, rather than adding the styles for a hover state to an existing class, you add another class to the element that only does something on hover:
In Tailwind, separate classes are used for the default state and the hover state
.bg-sky-500 { background-color: #0ea5e9;}.hover\:bg-sky-700:hover { background-color: #0369a1;}
Notice how hover:bg-sky-700 only defines styles for the :hover state? It does nothing by default, but as soon as you hover over an element with that class, the background color will change to sky-700.
This is what we mean when we say a utility class can be applied conditionally — by using variants you can control exactly how your design behaves in different states, without ever leaving your HTML.
Tailwind includes variants for just about everything you'll ever need, including:
• Pseudo-classes, like :hover, :focus, :first-child, and :required
• Pseudo-elements, like ::before, ::after, ::placeholder, and ::selection
• Media and feature queries, like responsive breakpoints, dark mode, and prefers-reduced-motion
• Attribute selectors, like [dir="rtl"] and [open]
• Child selectors, like & > * and & *
These variants can even be stacked to target more specific situations, for example changing the background color in dark mode, at the medium breakpoint, on hover:
<button class="dark:md:hover:bg-fuchsia-600 ...">Save changesbutton>
In this guide you'll learn about every variant available in the framework, how to use them with your own custom classes, and even how to create your own.
Pseudo-classes
:hover, :focus, and :active
Style elements on hover, focus, and active using the hover, focus, and active variants:
Try interacting with this button to see the hover, focus, and active states
<button class="bg-violet-500 hover:bg-violet-600 focus:outline-2 focus:outline-offset-2 focus:outline-violet-500 active:bg-violet-700 ..."> Save changesbutton>
Tailwind also includes variants for other interactive states like :visited, :focus-within, :focus-visible, and more.
See the pseudo-class reference for a complete list of available pseudo-class variants.
:first, :last, :odd, and :even
Style an element when it is the first-child or last-child using the first and last variants:
You can also style an element when it's an odd or even child using the odd and even variants:
<table> <tbody> {#each people as person} <tr class="odd:bg-white even:bg-gray-50 dark:odd:bg-gray-900/50 dark:even:bg-gray-950"> <td>{person.name}td> <td>{person.title}td> <td>{person.email}td> tr> {/each} tbody>table>
Use the nth-* and nth-last-* variants to style children based on their position in the list:
<div class="nth-3:underline"> div><div class="nth-last-5:underline"> div><div class="nth-of-type-4:underline"> div><div class="nth-last-of-type-6:underline"> div>
You can pass any number you want to these by default, and use arbitrary values for more complex expressions like nth-[2n+1_of_li].
Tailwind also includes variants for other structural pseudo-classes like :only-child, :first-of-type, :empty, and more.
See the pseudo-class reference for a complete list of available pseudo-class variants.
:required and :disabled
Style form elements in different states using variants like required, invalid, and disabled:
Try making the email address valid to see the styles change
<input type="text" value="tbone" disabled class="invalid:border-pink-500 invalid:text-pink-600 focus:border-sky-500 focus:outline focus:outline-sky-500 focus:invalid:border-pink-500 focus:invalid:outline-pink-500 disabled:border-gray-200 disabled:bg-gray-50 disabled:text-gray-500 disabled:shadow-none dark:disabled:border-gray-700 dark:disabled:bg-gray-800/20 ..."/>
Using variants for this sort of thing can reduce the amount of conditional logic in your templates, letting you use the same set of classes regardless of what state an input is in and letting the browser apply the right styles for you.
Tailwind also includes variants for other form states like :read-only, :indeterminate, :checked, and more.
See the pseudo-class reference for a complete list of available pseudo-class variants.
Use the has-* variant to style an element based on the state or content of its descendants:
<label class="has-checked:bg-indigo-50 has-checked:text-indigo-900 has-checked:ring-indigo-200 dark:has-checked:bg-indigo-950 dark:has-checked:text-indigo-200 dark:has-checked:ring-indigo-900 ..."> <svg fill="currentColor"> svg> Google Pay <input type="radio" class="checked:border-indigo-500 ..." />label>
You can use has-* with a pseudo-class, like has-[:focus], to style an element based on the state of its descendants. You can also use element selectors, like has-[img] or has-[a], to style an element based on the content of its descendants.
Styling based on the descendants of a group
If you need to style an element based on the descendants of a parent element, you can mark the parent with the group class and use the group-has-* variant to style the target element:
A multidisciplinary designer, working at the intersection of art and technology.
Pushing pixels. Slinging divs.
<div class="group ..."> <img src="..." /> <h4>Spencer Sharph4> <svg class="hidden group-has-[a]:block ...">svg> <p>Product Designer at <a href="...">planeteria.techa>p>div>
Styling based on the descendants of a peer
If you need to style an element based on the descendants of a sibling element, you can mark the sibling with the peer class and use the peer-has-* variant to style the target element:
<div> <label class="peer ..."> <input type="checkbox" name="todo[1]" checked /> Create a to do list label> <svg class="peer-has-checked:hidden ...">svg>div>
Use the not- variant to style an element when a condition is not true.
It's particularly powerful when combined with other pseudo-class variants, for example combining not-focus: with hover: to only apply hover styles when an element is not focused:
Try focusing on the button and then hovering over it
<button class="bg-indigo-600 hover:not-focus:bg-indigo-700"> button>
You can also combine the not- variant with media query variants like forced-colors or supports to only style an element when something about the user's environment is not true:
<div class="not-supports-[display:grid]:flex"> div>
Styling based on parent state
When you need to style an element based on the state of some parent element, mark the parent with the group class, and use group-* variants like group-hover to style the target element:
Hover over the card to see both text elements change color
<a href="#" class="group ..."> <div> <svg class="stroke-sky-500 group-hover:stroke-white ..." fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24"> svg> <h3 class="text-gray-900 group-hover:text-white ...">New projecth3> div> <p class="text-gray-500 group-hover:text-white ...">Create a new project from a variety of starting templates.p>a>
This pattern works with every pseudo-class variant, for example group-focus, group-active, or even group-odd.
Differentiating nested groups
When nesting groups, you can style something based on the state of a specific parent group by giving that parent a unique group name using a group/{name} class, and including that name in variants using classes like group-hover/{name}:
<ul role="list"> {#each people as person} <li class="group/item ..."> <a class="group/edit invisible group-hover/item:visible ..." href="tel:{person.phone}"> <span class="group-hover/edit:text-gray-700 ...">Callspan> <svg class="group-hover/edit:translate-x-0.5 group-hover/edit:text-gray-500 ...">svg> a> li> {/each}ul>
Groups can be named however you like and don’t need to be configured in any way — just name your groups directly in your markup and Tailwind will automatically generate the necessary CSS.
Arbitrary groups
You can create one-off group-* variants on the fly by providing your own selector as an arbitrary value between square brackets:
<div class="group is-published"> <div class="hidden group-[.is-published]:block"> Published div>div>
For more control, you can use the & character to mark where .group should end up in the final selector relative to the selector you are passing in:
<div class="group"> <div class="group-[:nth-of-type(3)_&]:block"> div>div>
Implicit groups
The in-* variant works similarly to group except you don't need to add group to the parent element:
<div tabindex="0" class="group"> <div class="opacity-50 group-focus:opacity-100"><div tabindex="0"> <div class="opacity-50 in-focus:opacity-100"> div>div>
The in-* variant responds to state changes in any parent, so if you want more fine-grained control you'll need to use group instead.
Styling based on sibling state
When you need to style an element based on the state of a sibling element, mark the sibling with the peer class, and use peer-* variants like peer-invalid to style the target element:
Try making the email address valid to see the warning disappear
Please provide a valid email address.
<form> <label class="block"> <span class="...">Emailspan> <input type="email" class="peer ..." /> <p class="invisible peer-invalid:visible ...">Please provide a valid email address.p> label>form>
This makes it possible to do all sorts of neat tricks, like floating labels for example without any JS.
This pattern works with every pseudo-class variant, for example peer-focus, peer-required, and peer-disabled.
It's important to note that the peer marker can only be used on previous siblings because of how the subsequent-sibling combinator works in CSS:
Won't work, only previous siblings can be marked as peers
<label> <span class="peer-invalid:text-red-500 ...">Emailspan> <input type="email" class="peer ..." />label>
Differentiating peers
When using multiple peers, you can style something on the state of a specific peer by giving that peer a unique name using a peer/{name} class, and including that name in variants using classes like peer-checked/{name}:
<fieldset> <legend>Published statuslegend> <input id="draft" class="peer/draft" type="radio" name="status" checked /> <label for="draft" class="peer-checked/draft:text-sky-500">Draftlabel> <input id="published" class="peer/published" type="radio" name="status" /> <label for="published" class="peer-checked/published:text-sky-500">Publishedlabel> <div class="hidden peer-checked/draft:block">Drafts are only visible to administrators.div> <div class="hidden peer-checked/published:block">Your post will be publicly visible on your site.div>fieldset>
Peers can be named however you like and don’t need to be configured in any way — just name your peers directly in your markup and Tailwind will automatically generate the necessary CSS.
Arbitrary peers
You can create one-off peer-* variants on the fly by providing your own selector as an arbitrary value between square brackets:
<form> <label for="email">Email:label> <input id="email" name="email" type="email" class="is-dirty peer" required /> <div class="peer-[.is-dirty]:peer-required:block hidden">This field is required.div> form>
For more control, you can use the & character to mark where .peer should end up in the final selector relative to the selector you are passing in:
<div> <input type="text" class="peer" /> <div class="hidden peer-[:nth-of-type(3)_&]:block"> div>div>
Pseudo-elements
::before and ::after
Style the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements using the before and after variants:
<label> <span class="text-gray-700 after:ml-0.5 after:text-red-500 after:content-['*'] ...">Emailspan> <input type="email" name="email" class="..." placeholder="you@example.com" />label>
When using these variants, Tailwind will automatically add content: '' by default so you don't have to specify it unless you want a different value:
When you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy.
<blockquote class="text-center text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 italic dark:text-white"> When you look <span class="relative inline-block before:absolute before:-inset-1 before:block before:-skew-y-3 before:bg-pink-500"> <span class="relative text-white dark:text-gray-950">annoyedspan> span> all the time, people think that you're busy.blockquote>
It's worth noting that you don't really need ::before and ::after pseudo-elements for most things in Tailwind projects — it's usually simpler to just use a real HTML element.
For example, here's the same design from above but using a instead of the ::before pseudo-element, which is a little easier to read and is actually less code:
<blockquote class="text-center text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 italic"> When you look <span class="relative"> <span class="absolute -inset-1 block -skew-y-3 bg-pink-500" aria-hidden="true">span> <span class="relative text-white">annoyedspan> span> all the time, people think that you're busy.blockquote>
Save before and after for situations where it's important that the content of the pseudo-element is not actually in the DOM and can't be selected by the user.
::placeholder
Style the placeholder text of any input or textarea using the placeholder variant:
<input class="placeholder:text-gray-500 placeholder:italic ..." placeholder="Search for anything..." type="text" name="search"/>
Style the button in file inputs using the file variant:
<input type="file" class="file:mr-4 file:rounded-full file:border-0 file:bg-violet-50 file:px-4 file:py-2 file:text-sm file:font-semibold file:text-violet-700 hover:file:bg-violet-100 dark:file:bg-violet-600 dark:file:text-violet-100 dark:hover:file:bg-violet-500 ..."/>
Style the counters or bullets in lists using the marker variant:
Ingredients
• 5 cups chopped Porcini mushrooms
• 1/2 cup of olive oil
<ul role="list" class="list-disc marker:text-sky-400 ..."> <li>5 cups chopped Porcini mushroomsli> <li>1/2 cup of olive oilli> <li>3lb of celeryli>ul>
We've designed the marker variant to be inheritable, so although you can use it directly on an
• element, you can also use it on a parent to avoid repeating yourself. ::selection Style the active text selection using the selection variant: Try selecting some of this text with your mouseSo I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I was a marine biologist.<div class="selection:bg-fuchsia-300 selection:text-fuchsia-900"> <p> So I started to walk into the water.

Responsive breakpoints To style an element at a specific breakpoint, use responsive variants like md and lg. For example, this will render a 3-column grid on mobile, a 4-column grid on medium-width screens, and a 6-column grid on large-width screens: <div class="grid grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-6"> div> To style an element based on the width of a parent element instead of the viewport, use variants like @md and @lg: <div class="@container"> <div class="flex flex-col @md:flex-row"> div>div> Check out the Responsive design documentation for an in-depth look at how these features work. prefers-color-scheme The prefers-color-scheme media query tells you whether the user prefers a light theme or dark theme, and is usually configured at the operating system level. Use utilities with no variant to target light mode, and use the dark variant to provide overrides for dark mode: Light modeWrites upside-downThe Zero Gravity Pen can be used to write in any orientation, including upside-down. It even works in outer space.Dark modeWrites upside-downThe Zero Gravity Pen can be used to write in any orientation, including upside-down.

It even works in outer space. p>div> Check out the Dark Mode documentation for an in-depth look at how this feature works. prefers-reduced-motion The prefers-reduced-motion media query tells you if the user has requested that you minimize non-essential motion. Use the motion-reduce variant to conditionally add styles when the user has requested reduced motion: Try emulating `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` in your developer tools to hide the spinner<button type="button" class="bg-indigo-500 ..." disabled> <svg class="animate-spin motion-reduce:hidden ..." viewBox="0 0 24 24">svg> Processing...button> Tailwind also includes a motion-safe variant that only adds styles when the user has not requested reduced motion. This can be useful when using the motion-reduce helper would mean having to "undo" a lot of styles: <button class="transition hover:-translate-y-0.5 motion-reduce:transition-none motion-reduce:hover:translate-y-0 ..."> Save changesbutton><button class="motion-safe:transition motion-safe:hover:-translate-x-0.5 ...">Save changesbutton> prefers-contrast The prefers-contrast media query tells you if the user has requested more or less contrast.

These modes override your site's colors with a user defined palette for text, backgrounds, links and buttons. Use the forced-colors variant to conditionally add styles when the user has enabled a forced color mode: Try emulating `forced-colors: active` in your developer tools to see the changes<label> <input type="radio" class="appearance-none forced-colors:appearance-auto" /> <p class="hidden forced-colors:block">Cyanp> <div class="bg-cyan-200 forced-colors:hidden ...">div> <div class="bg-cyan-500 forced-colors:hidden ...">div>label> Use the not-forced-colors variant to apply styles based when the user is not using a forced colors mode: <div class="not-forced-colors:appearance-none ..."> div> Tailwind also includes a forced color adjust utilities to opt in and out of forced colors. inverted-colors Use the inverted-colors variant to conditionally add styles when the user has enabled an inverted color scheme: <div class="shadow-xl inverted-colors:shadow-none ..."> div> pointer and any-pointer The pointer media query tells you whether the user has a primary pointing device, like a mouse, and the accuracy of that pointing device. Use the pointer-fine variant to target an accurate pointing device, like a mouse or trackpad, or the pointer-coarse variant to target a less accurate pointing device, like a touchscreen, which can be useful for providing larger click targets on touch devices: Try emulating a touch device in your developer tools to see the changes<fieldset aria-label="Choose a memory option"> <div class="flex items-center justify-between"> <div>RAMdiv> <a href="#"> See performance specs a> div> <div class="mt-4 grid grid-cols-6 gap-2 pointer-coarse:mt-6 pointer-coarse:grid-cols-3 pointer-coarse:gap-4"> <label class="p-2 pointer-coarse:p-4 ..."> <input type="radio" name="memory-option" value="4 GB" className="sr-only" /> <span>4 GBspan> label> div>fieldset> While pointeronly targets the primary pointing device, any-pointer is used to target any of the pointing devices that might be available. Use the any-pointer-fine and any-pointer-coarse variants to provide different styles if at least one connected pointing device meets the criteria. You can use pointer-none and any-pointer-none to target the absence of a pointing device. orientation Use the portrait and landscape variants to conditionally add styles when the viewport is in a specific orientation: <div> <div class="portrait:hidden"> div> <div class="landscape:hidden"> <p>This experience is designed to be viewed in landscape. Please rotate your device to view the site.p> div>div> scripting Use the noscript variant to conditionally add styles based on whether the user has scripting, such as JavaScript, enabled: <div class="hidden noscript:block"> <p>This experience requires JavaScript to function. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.p>div> print Use the print variant to conditionally add styles that only apply when the document is being printed: <div> <article class="print:hidden"> <h1>My Secret Pizza Recipeh1> <p>This recipe is a secret, and must not be shared with anyonep> article> <div class="hidden print:block">Are you seriously trying to print this? It's secret!div>div> @supports Use the supports-[...] variant to style things based on whether a certain feature is supported in the user's browser: <div class="flex supports-[display:grid]:grid ..."> div> Under the hood the supports-[...] variant generates @supports rules and takes anything you’d use with @supports (...) between the square brackets, like a property/value pair, and even expressions using and and or. For terseness, if you only need to check if a property is supported (and not a specific value), you can just specify the property name: <div class="bg-black/75 supports-backdrop-filter:bg-black/25 supports-backdrop-filter:backdrop-blur ..."> div> Use the not-supports-[...] variant to style things based on whether a certain feature is not supported in the user's browser: <div class="not-supports-[display:grid]:flex"> div> You can configure shortcuts for common @supports rules you're using in your project by creating a new variant in the supports-* namespace: @custom-variant supports-grid { @supports (display: grid) { @slot; }} You can then use these custom supports-* variants in your project: <div class="supports-grid:grid"> div> @starting-style Use the starting variant to set the appearance of an element when it is first rendered in the DOM, or transitions from display: none to visible: <div> <button popovertarget="my-popover">Check for updatesbutton> <div popover id="my-popover" class="opacity-0 starting:open:opacity-0 ..."> div>div> Attribute selectors ARIA states Use the aria-* variant to conditionally style things based on ARIA attributes. For example, to apply the bg-sky-700 class when the aria-checked attribute is set to true, use the aria-checked:bg-sky-700 class: <div aria-checked="true" class="bg-gray-600 aria-checked:bg-sky-700"> div> By default we've included variants for the most common boolean ARIA attributes: VariantCSSaria-busy&[aria-busy="true"]aria-checked&[aria-checked="true"]aria-disabled&[aria-disabled="true"]aria-expanded&[aria-expanded="true"]aria-hidden&[aria-hidden="true"]aria-pressed&[aria-pressed="true"]aria-readonly&[aria-readonly="true"]aria-required&[aria-required="true"]aria-selected&[aria-selected="true"] You can customize which aria-* variants are available by creating a new variant: @custom-variant aria-asc (&[aria-sort="ascending"]);@custom-variant aria-desc (&[aria-sort="descending"]); If you need to use a one-off aria variant that doesn’t make sense to include in your project, or for more complex ARIA attributes that take specific values, use square brackets to generate a property on the fly using any arbitrary value: Invoice #ClientAmount#100Pendant Publishing$2,000.00#101Kruger Industrial Smoothing$545.00#102J.

Child selectors Styling direct children While it's generally preferable to put utility classes directly on child elements, you can use the * variant in situations where you need to style direct children that you don’t have control over: CategoriesSalesMarketingSEOAnalyticsDesignStrategySecurityGrowthMobileUX/UI<div> <h2>Categories<h2> <ul class="*:rounded-full *:border *:border-sky-100 *:bg-sky-50 *:px-2 *:py-0.5 dark:text-sky-300 dark:*:border-sky-500/15 dark:*:bg-sky-500/10 ..."> <li>Salesli> <li>Marketingli> <li>SEOli> ul>div> It's important to note that overriding a style with a utility directly on the child itself won't work since children rules are generated after the regular ones and they have the same specificity: Won't work, children can't override styles given to them by the parent. <ul class="*:bg-sky-50 ..."> <li class="bg-red-50 ...">Salesli> <li>Marketingli> <li>SEOli> ul> Styling all descendants Like *, the ** variant can be used to style children of an element. The main difference is that ** will apply styles to all descendants, not just the direct children. This is especially useful when you combine it with another variant for narrowing the thing you're selecting: <ul class="**:data-avatar:size-12 **:data-avatar:rounded-full ..."> {#each items as item} <li> <img src={item.src} data-avatar /> <p>{item.name}p> li> {/each}ul> Custom variants Using arbitrary variants Just like arbitrary values let you use custom values with your utility classes, arbitrary variants let you write custom selector variants directly in your HTML. Arbitrary variants are just format strings that represent the selector, wrapped in square brackets. For example, this arbitrary variant changes the cursor to grabbing when the element has the is-dragging class: <ul role="list"> {#each items as item} <li class="[&.is-dragging]:cursor-grabbing">{item}li> {/each}ul> Arbitrary variants can be stacked with built-in variants or with each other, just like the rest of the variants in Tailwind: <ul role="list"> {#each items as item} <li class="[&.is-dragging]:active:cursor-grabbing">{item}li> {/each}ul> If you need spaces in your selector, you can use an underscore. For example, this arbitrary variant selects all p elements within the element where you've added the class: <div class="[&_p]:mt-4"> <p>Lorem ipsum...p> <ul> <li> <p>Lorem ipsum...p> li> ul>div> You can also use at-rules like @media or @supports in arbitrary variants: <div class="flex [@supports(display:grid)]:grid"> div> With at-rule custom variants the & placeholder isn't necessary, just like when nesting with a preprocessor. Registering a custom variant If you find yourself using the same arbitrary variant multiple times in your project, it might be worth creating a custom variant using the @custom-variant directive: @custom-variant theme-midnight (&:where([data-theme="midnight"] *)); Now you can use the theme-midnight: variant in your HTML: <html data-theme="midnight"> <button class="theme-midnight:bg-black ...">button>html> Learn more about adding custom variants in the adding custom variants documentation.

::selection
Style the active text selection using the selection variant:
Try selecting some of this text with your mouse
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I was a marine biologist.
<div class="selection:bg-fuchsia-300 selection:text-fuchsia-900"> <p> So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>wasem> a marine biologist. p>div>
We've designed the selection variant to be inheritable, so you can add it anywhere in the tree and it will be applied to all descendant elements.
This makes it easy to set the selection color to match your brand across your entire site:
<html> <head> head> <body class="selection:bg-pink-300"> body>html>
::first-line and ::first-letter
Style the first line in a block of content using the first-line variant, and the first letter using the first-letter variant:
Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.
Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior.
<div class="text-gray-700"> <p class="first-letter:float-left first-letter:mr-3 first-letter:text-7xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-gray-900 first-line:tracking-widest first-line:uppercase" > Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says "New York Public Library"? p> <p class="mt-6">Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.p>div>
::backdrop
Style the backdrop of a native
<dialog class="backdrop:bg-gray-50"> <form method="dialog"> form>dialog>
Responsive breakpoints
To style an element at a specific breakpoint, use responsive variants like md and lg.
For example, this will render a 3-column grid on mobile, a 4-column grid on medium-width screens, and a 6-column grid on large-width screens:
<div class="grid grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-6"> div>
To style an element based on the width of a parent element instead of the viewport, use variants like @md and @lg:
<div class="@container"> <div class="flex flex-col @md:flex-row"> div>div>
Check out the Responsive design documentation for an in-depth look at how these features work.
prefers-color-scheme
The prefers-color-scheme media query tells you whether the user prefers a light theme or dark theme, and is usually configured at the operating system level.
Use utilities with no variant to target light mode, and use the dark variant to provide overrides for dark mode:
The Zero Gravity Pen can be used to write in any orientation, including upside-down. It even works in outer space.
The Zero Gravity Pen can be used to write in any orientation, including upside-down. It even works in outer space.
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 ..."> <h3 class="text-gray-900 dark:text-white ...">Writes upside-downh3> <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 ..."> The Zero Gravity Pen can be used to write in any orientation, including upside-down. It even works in outer space. p>div>
Check out the Dark Mode documentation for an in-depth look at how this feature works.
prefers-reduced-motion
The prefers-reduced-motion media query tells you if the user has requested that you minimize non-essential motion.
Use the motion-reduce variant to conditionally add styles when the user has requested reduced motion:
Try emulating `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` in your developer tools to hide the spinner
<button type="button" class="bg-indigo-500 ..." disabled> <svg class="animate-spin motion-reduce:hidden ..." viewBox="0 0 24 24">svg> Processing...button>
Tailwind also includes a motion-safe variant that only adds styles when the user has not requested reduced motion. This can be useful when using the motion-reduce helper would mean having to "undo" a lot of styles:
<button class="transition hover:-translate-y-0.5 motion-reduce:transition-none motion-reduce:hover:translate-y-0 ..."> Save changesbutton><button class="motion-safe:transition motion-safe:hover:-translate-x-0.5 ...">Save changesbutton>
prefers-contrast
The prefers-contrast media query tells you if the user has requested more or less contrast.
Use the contrast-more variant to conditionally add styles when the user has requested more contrast:
Try emulating `prefers-contrast: more` in your developer tools to see the changes
We need this to steal your identity.
<label class="block"> <span class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">Social Security Numberspan> <input class="border-gray-200 placeholder-gray-400 contrast-more:border-gray-400 contrast-more:placeholder-gray-500 ..." /> <p class="text-gray-600 opacity-10 contrast-more:opacity-100 ...">We need this to steal your identity.p>label>
Tailwind also includes a contrast-less variant you can use to conditionally add styles when the user has requested less contrast.
forced-colors
The forced-colors media query indicates if the user is using a forced colors mode. These modes override your site's colors with a user defined palette for text, backgrounds, links and buttons.
Use the forced-colors variant to conditionally add styles when the user has enabled a forced color mode:
Try emulating `forced-colors: active` in your developer tools to see the changes
<label> <input type="radio" class="appearance-none forced-colors:appearance-auto" /> <p class="hidden forced-colors:block">Cyanp> <div class="bg-cyan-200 forced-colors:hidden ...">div> <div class="bg-cyan-500 forced-colors:hidden ...">div>label>
Use the not-forced-colors variant to apply styles based when the user is not using a forced colors mode:
<div class="not-forced-colors:appearance-none ..."> div>
Tailwind also includes a forced color adjust utilities to opt in and out of forced colors.
inverted-colors
Use the inverted-colors variant to conditionally add styles when the user has enabled an inverted color scheme:
<div class="shadow-xl inverted-colors:shadow-none ..."> div>
pointer and any-pointer
The pointer media query tells you whether the user has a primary pointing device, like a mouse, and the accuracy of that pointing device.
Use the pointer-fine variant to target an accurate pointing device, like a mouse or trackpad, or the pointer-coarse variant to target a less accurate pointing device, like a touchscreen, which can be useful for providing larger click targets on touch devices:
Try emulating a touch device in your developer tools to see the changes
<fieldset aria-label="Choose a memory option"> <div class="flex items-center justify-between"> <div>RAMdiv> <a href="#"> See performance specs a> div> <div class="mt-4 grid grid-cols-6 gap-2 pointer-coarse:mt-6 pointer-coarse:grid-cols-3 pointer-coarse:gap-4"> <label class="p-2 pointer-coarse:p-4 ..."> <input type="radio" name="memory-option" value="4 GB" className="sr-only" /> <span>4 GBspan> label> div>fieldset>
While pointeronly targets the primary pointing device, any-pointer is used to target any of the pointing devices that might be available. Use the any-pointer-fine and any-pointer-coarse variants to provide different styles if at least one connected pointing device meets the criteria.
You can use pointer-none and any-pointer-none to target the absence of a pointing device.
orientation
Use the portrait and landscape variants to conditionally add styles when the viewport is in a specific orientation:
<div> <div class="portrait:hidden"> div> <div class="landscape:hidden"> <p>This experience is designed to be viewed in landscape. Please rotate your device to view the site.p> div>div>
Use the noscript variant to conditionally add styles based on whether the user has scripting, such as JavaScript, enabled:
<div class="hidden noscript:block"> <p>This experience requires JavaScript to function. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.p>div>
Use the print variant to conditionally add styles that only apply when the document is being printed:
<div> <article class="print:hidden"> <h1>My Secret Pizza Recipeh1> <p>This recipe is a secret, and must not be shared with anyonep> article> <div class="hidden print:block">Are you seriously trying to print this? It's secret!div>div>
Use the supports-[...] variant to style things based on whether a certain feature is supported in the user's browser:
<div class="flex supports-[display:grid]:grid ..."> div>
Under the hood the supports-[...] variant generates @supports rules and takes anything you’d use with @supports (...) between the square brackets, like a property/value pair, and even expressions using and and or.
For terseness, if you only need to check if a property is supported (and not a specific value), you can just specify the property name:
<div class="bg-black/75 supports-backdrop-filter:bg-black/25 supports-backdrop-filter:backdrop-blur ..."> div>
Use the not-supports-[...] variant to style things based on whether a certain feature is not supported in the user's browser:
<div class="not-supports-[display:grid]:flex"> div>
You can configure shortcuts for common @supports rules you're using in your project by creating a new variant in the supports-* namespace:
@custom-variant supports-grid { @supports (display: grid) { @slot; }}
You can then use these custom supports-* variants in your project:
<div class="supports-grid:grid"> div>
@starting-style
Use the starting variant to set the appearance of an element when it is first rendered in the DOM, or transitions from display: none to visible:
<div> <button popovertarget="my-popover">Check for updatesbutton> <div popover id="my-popover" class="opacity-0 starting:open:opacity-0 ..."> div>div>
Attribute selectors
ARIA states
Use the aria-* variant to conditionally style things based on ARIA attributes.
For example, to apply the bg-sky-700 class when the aria-checked attribute is set to true, use the aria-checked:bg-sky-700 class:
<div aria-checked="true" class="bg-gray-600 aria-checked:bg-sky-700"> div>
By default we've included variants for the most common boolean ARIA attributes:
You can customize which aria-* variants are available by creating a new variant:
@custom-variant aria-asc (&[aria-sort="ascending"]);@custom-variant aria-desc (&[aria-sort="descending"]);
If you need to use a one-off aria variant that doesn’t make sense to include in your project, or for more complex ARIA attributes that take specific values, use square brackets to generate a property on the fly using any arbitrary value:
<table> <thead> <tr> <th aria-sort="ascending" class="aria-[sort=ascending]:bg-[url('/img/down-arrow.svg')] aria-[sort=descending]:bg-[url('/img/up-arrow.svg')]" > Invoice # th> tr> thead> table>
ARIA state variants can also target parent and sibling elements using the group-aria-* and peer-aria-* variants:
<table> <thead> <tr> <th aria-sort="ascending" class="group"> Invoice # <svg class="group-aria-[sort=ascending]:rotate-0 group-aria-[sort=descending]:rotate-180">svg> th> tr> thead> table>
Data attributes
Use the data-* variant to conditionally apply styles based on data attributes.
To check if a data attribute exists (and not a specific value), you can just specify the attribute name:
<div data-active class="border border-gray-300 data-active:border-purple-500"> div><div class="border border-gray-300 data-active:border-purple-500"> div>
If you need to check for a specific value you may use an arbitrary value:
<div data-size="large" class="data-[size=large]:p-8"> div><div data-size="medium" class="data-[size=large]:p-8"> div>
Alternatively, you can configure shortcuts for common data attributes you're using in your project by creating a new variant in the data-* namespace:
@import "tailwindcss";@custom-variant data-checked (&[data-ui~="checked"]);
You can then use these custom data-* variants in your project:
<div data-ui="checked active" class="data-checked:underline"> div>
RTL support
Use the rtl and ltr variants to conditionally add styles in right-to-left and left-to-right modes respectively when building multi-directional layouts:
<div class="group flex items-center"> <img class="h-12 w-12 shrink-0 rounded-full" src="..." alt="" /> <div class="ltr:ml-3 rtl:mr-3"> <p class="text-gray-700 group-hover:text-gray-900 ...">...p> <p class="text-gray-500 group-hover:text-gray-700 ...">...p> div>div>
Remember, these variants are only useful if you are building a site that needs to support both left-to-right and right-to-left layouts. If you're building a site that only needs to support a single direction, you don't need these variants — just apply the styles that make sense for your content.
Open/closed state
Use the open variant to conditionally add styles when a
Try toggling the disclosure to see the styles change
The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it Roundtine.
<details class="border border-transparent open:border-black/10 open:bg-gray-100 ..." open> <summary class="text-sm leading-6 font-semibold text-gray-900 select-none">Why do they call it Ovaltine?summary> <div class="mt-3 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600"> <p>The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it Roundtine.p> div>details>
This variant also targets the :popover-open pseudo-class for popovers:
<div> <button popovertarget="my-popover">Open Popoverbutton> <div popover id="my-popover" class="opacity-0 open:opacity-100 ..."> div>div>
Styling inert elements
The inert variant lets you style elements marked with the inert attribute:
<form> <legend>Notification preferenceslegend> <fieldset> <input type="radio" /> <label> Custom label> <fieldset inert class="inert:opacity-50"> fieldset> <input type="radio" /> <label> Everything label> fieldset>form>
This is useful for adding visual cues that make it clear that sections of content aren't interactive.
Child selectors
Styling direct children
While it's generally preferable to put utility classes directly on child elements, you can use the * variant in situations where you need to style direct children that you don’t have control over:
Categories
<div> <h2>Categories<h2> <ul class="*:rounded-full *:border *:border-sky-100 *:bg-sky-50 *:px-2 *:py-0.5 dark:text-sky-300 dark:*:border-sky-500/15 dark:*:bg-sky-500/10 ..."> <li>Salesli> <li>Marketingli> <li>SEOli> ul>div>
It's important to note that overriding a style with a utility directly on the child itself won't work since children rules are generated after the regular ones and they have the same specificity:
Won't work, children can't override styles given to them by the parent.
<ul class="*:bg-sky-50 ..."> <li class="bg-red-50 ...">Salesli> <li>Marketingli> <li>SEOli> ul>
Styling all descendants
Like *, the ** variant can be used to style children of an element. The main difference is that ** will apply styles to all descendants, not just the direct children. This is especially useful when you combine it with another variant for narrowing the thing you're selecting:
<ul class="**:data-avatar:size-12 **:data-avatar:rounded-full ..."> {#each items as item} <li> <img src={item.src} data-avatar /> <p>{item.name}p> li> {/each}ul>
Custom variants
Using arbitrary variants
Just like arbitrary values let you use custom values with your utility classes, arbitrary variants let you write custom selector variants directly in your HTML.
Arbitrary variants are just format strings that represent the selector, wrapped in square brackets. For example, this arbitrary variant changes the cursor to grabbing when the element has the is-dragging class:
<ul role="list"> {#each items as item} <li class="[&.is-dragging]:cursor-grabbing">{item}li> {/each}ul>
Arbitrary variants can be stacked with built-in variants or with each other, just like the rest of the variants in Tailwind:
<ul role="list"> {#each items as item} <li class="[&.is-dragging]:active:cursor-grabbing">{item}li> {/each}ul>
If you need spaces in your selector, you can use an underscore. For example, this arbitrary variant selects all p elements within the element where you've added the class:
<div class="[&_p]:mt-4"> <p>Lorem ipsum...p> <ul> <li> <p>Lorem ipsum...p> li> ul>div>
You can also use at-rules like @media or @supports in arbitrary variants:
<div class="flex [@supports(display:grid)]:grid"> div>
With at-rule custom variants the & placeholder isn't necessary, just like when nesting with a preprocessor.
Registering a custom variant
If you find yourself using the same arbitrary variant multiple times in your project, it might be worth creating a custom variant using the @custom-variant directive:
@custom-variant theme-midnight (&:where([data-theme="midnight"] *));
Now you can use the theme-midnight: variant in your HTML:
<html data-theme="midnight"> <button class="theme-midnight:bg-black ...">button>html>
Learn more about adding custom variants in the adding custom variants documentation.
