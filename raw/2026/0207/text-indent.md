Utilities for controlling the amount of empty space shown before text in a block.
text-indent: calc(var(--spacing) * );
text-indent: calc(var(--spacing) * -);
Basic example
Use indent- utilities like indent-2 and indent-8 to set the amount of empty space (indentation) that's shown before text in a block:
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I was a marine biologist.
<p class="indent-8">So I started to walk into the water...p>
Using negative values
To use a negative text indent value, prefix the class name with a dash to convert it to a negative value:
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I was a marine biologist.
<p class="-indent-8">So I started to walk into the water...p>
Using a custom value
Use the indent-[] syntax to set the text indentation based on a completely custom value:
<p class="indent-[50%] ..."> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...p>
For CSS variables, you can also use the indent-() syntax:
<p class="indent-(--my-indentation) ..."> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...p>
This is just a shorthand for indent-[var()] that adds the var() function for you automatically.
Responsive design
Prefix a text-indent utility with a breakpoint variant like md: to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
<p class="indent-4 md:indent-8 ..."> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...p>
Learn more about using variants in the variants documentation.
