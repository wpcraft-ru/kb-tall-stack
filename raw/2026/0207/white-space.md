Utilities for controlling an element's white-space property.
Use the whitespace-normal utility to cause text to wrap normally within an element. Newlines and spaces will be collapsed:
Hey everyone! It’s almost 2022 and we still don’t know if there are aliens living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien. You will never know.
<p class="whitespace-normal">Hey everyone!It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there are aliens living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien.You will never know.p>
Use the whitespace-nowrap utility to prevent text from wrapping within an element. Newlines and spaces will be collapsed:
Hey everyone! It’s almost 2022 and we still don’t know if there are aliens living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien. You will never know.
<p class="overflow-auto whitespace-nowrap">Hey everyone!It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there are aliens living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien.You will never know.p>
Use the whitespace-pre utility to preserve newlines and spaces within an element. Text will not be wrapped:
Hey everyone! It’s almost 2022 and we still don’t know if there are aliens living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien. You will never know.
<p class="overflow-auto whitespace-pre">Hey everyone!It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there are aliens living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien.You will never know.p>
Use the whitespace-pre-line utility to preserve newlines but not spaces within an element. Text will be wrapped normally:
Hey everyone! It’s almost 2022 and we still don’t know if there are aliens living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien. You will never know.
<p class="whitespace-pre-line">Hey everyone!It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there are aliens living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien.You will never know.p>
Use the whitespace-pre-wrap utility to preserve newlines and spaces within an element. Text will be wrapped normally:
Hey everyone! It’s almost 2022 and we still don’t know if there are aliens living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien. You will never know.
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">Hey everyone!It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there are aliens living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien.You will never know.p>
Break Spaces
Use the whitespace-break-spaces utility to preserve newlines and spaces within an element. White space at the end of lines will not hang, but will wrap to the next line:
Hey everyone! It’s almost 2022 and we still don’t know if there are aliens living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien. You will never know.
<p class="whitespace-break-spaces">Hey everyone!It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there are aliens living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien.You will never know.p>
Responsive design
Prefix a white-space utility with a breakpoint variant like md: to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
<p class="whitespace-pre md:whitespace-normal ..."> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...p>
Learn more about using variants in the variants documentation.
