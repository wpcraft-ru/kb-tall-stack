Utilities for controlling how an individual flex or grid item is positioned along its container's cross axis.
Use the self-auto utility to align an item based on the value of the container's align-items property:
<div class="flex items-stretch ..."> <div>01div> <div class="self-auto ...">02div> <div>03div>div>
Use the self-start utility to align an item to the start of the container's cross axis, despite the container's align-items value:
<div class="flex items-stretch ..."> <div>01div> <div class="self-start ...">02div> <div>03div>div>
Use the self-center utility to align an item along the center of the container's cross axis, despite the container's align-items value:
<div class="flex items-stretch ..."> <div>01div> <div class="self-center ...">02div> <div>03div>div>
Use the self-end utility to align an item to the end of the container's cross axis, despite the container's align-items value:
<div class="flex items-stretch ..."> <div>01div> <div class="self-end ...">02div> <div>03div>div>
Use the self-stretch utility to stretch an item to fill the container's cross axis, despite the container's align-items value:
<div class="flex items-stretch ..."> <div>01div> <div class="self-stretch ...">02div> <div>03div>div>
Use the self-baseline utility to align an item such that its baseline aligns with the baseline of the flex container's cross axis:
<div class="flex ..."> <div class="self-baseline pt-2 pb-6">01div> <div class="self-baseline pt-8 pb-12">02div> <div class="self-baseline pt-12 pb-4">03div>div>
Last baseline
Use the self-baseline-last utility to align an item along the container's cross axis such that its baseline aligns with the last baseline in the container:
Working on the future of astronaut recruitment at Space Recruit.
<div class="grid grid-cols-[1fr_auto]"> <div> <img src="img/spencer-sharp.jpg" /> <h4>Spencer Sharph4> <p class="self-baseline-last">Working on the future of astronaut recruitment at Space Recruit.p> div> <p class="self-baseline-last">spacerecruit.comp>div>
This is useful for ensuring that text items align with each other, even if they have different heights.
Responsive design
Prefix an align-self utility with a breakpoint variant like md: to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
<div class="self-auto md:self-end ..."> div>
Learn more about using variants in the variants documentation.
