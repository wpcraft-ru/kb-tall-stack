Utilities for controlling word breaks in an element.
Use the break-normal utility to only add line breaks at normal word break points:
The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it is the same as silicosis.
<p class="break-normal">The longest word in any of the major...p>
Use the break-all utility to add line breaks whenever necessary, without trying to preserve whole words:
The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it is the same as silicosis.
<p class="break-all">The longest word in any of the major...p>
Break Keep
Use the break-keep utility to prevent line breaks from being applied to Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK) text:
抗衡不屈不挠 (kànghéng bùqū bùnáo) 这是一个长词，意思是不畏强暴，奋勇抗争，坚定不移，永不放弃。这个词通常用来描述那些在面对困难和挑战时坚持自己信念的人， 他们克服一切困难，不屈不挠地追求自己的目标。无论遇到多大的挑战，他们都能够坚持到底，不放弃，最终获得胜利。
<p class="break-keep">抗衡不屈不挠...p>
For non-CJK text the break-keep utility has the same behavior as the break-normal utility.
Responsive design
Prefix a word-break utility with a breakpoint variant like md: to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
<p class="break-normal md:break-all ..."> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...p>
Learn more about using variants in the variants documentation.
