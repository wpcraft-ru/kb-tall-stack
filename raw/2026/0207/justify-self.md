Utilities for controlling how an individual grid item is aligned along its inline axis.
Use the justify-self-auto utility to align an item based on the value of the grid's justify-items property:
<div class="grid justify-items-stretch ..."> <div class="justify-self-auto ...">02div> div>
Use the justify-self-start utility to align a grid item to the start of its inline axis:
<div class="grid justify-items-stretch ..."> <div class="justify-self-start ...">02div> div>
Use the justify-self-center or justify-self-center-safe utilities to align a grid item along the center of its inline axis:
Resize the container to see the alignment behavior
<div class="grid justify-items-stretch ..."> <div class="justify-self-center ...">02div> div>
<div class="grid justify-items-stretch ..."> <div class="justify-self-center-safe ...">02div> div>
When there is not enough space available, the justify-self-center-safe utility will align the item to the start of the container instead of the end.
Use the justify-self-end or justify-self-end-safe utilities to align a grid item to the end of its inline axis:
Resize the container to see the alignment behavior
<div class="grid justify-items-stretch ..."> <div class="justify-self-end ...">02div> div>
<div class="grid justify-items-stretch ..."> <div class="justify-self-end-safe ...">02div> div>
When there is not enough space available, the justify-self-end-safe utility will align the item to the start of the container instead of the end.
Use the justify-self-stretch utility to stretch a grid item to fill the grid area on its inline axis:
<div class="grid justify-items-start ..."> <div class="justify-self-stretch ...">02div> div>
Responsive design
Prefix a justify-self utility with a breakpoint variant like md: to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
<div class="justify-self-start md:justify-self-end ..."> div>
Learn more about using variants in the variants documentation.
