Utilities for controlling how flex items both grow and shrink.
Basic example
Use flex- utilities like flex-1 to allow a flex item to grow and shrink as needed, ignoring its initial size:
<div class="flex"> <div class="w-14 flex-none ...">01div> <div class="w-64 flex-1 ...">02div> <div class="w-32 flex-1 ...">03div>div>
Use flex-initial to allow a flex item to shrink but not grow, taking into account its initial size:
<div class="flex"> <div class="w-14 flex-none ...">01div> <div class="w-64 flex-initial ...">02div> <div class="w-32 flex-initial ...">03div>div>
Use flex-auto to allow a flex item to grow and shrink, taking into account its initial size:
<div class="flex ..."> <div class="w-14 flex-none ...">01div> <div class="w-64 flex-auto ...">02div> <div class="w-32 flex-auto ...">03div>div>
Use flex-none to prevent a flex item from growing or shrinking:
<div class="flex ..."> <div class="w-14 flex-none ...">01div> <div class="w-32 flex-none ...">02div> <div class="flex-1 ...">03div>div>
Using a custom value
Use the flex-[] syntax to set the flex shorthand property based on a completely custom value:
<div class="flex-[3_1_auto] ..."> div>
For CSS variables, you can also use the flex-() syntax:
<div class="flex-(--my-flex) ..."> div>
This is just a shorthand for flex-[var()] that adds the var() function for you automatically.
Responsive design
Prefix a flex utility with a breakpoint variant like md: to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
<div class="flex-none md:flex-1 ..."> div>
Learn more about using variants in the variants documentation.
