Utilities for applying backdrop filters to an element.
Basic example
Use utilities like backdrop-blur-xs and backdrop-grayscale to apply filters to an element's backdrop:
<div class="bg-[url(/img/mountains.jpg)] ..."> <div class="backdrop-blur-xs ...">div>div><div class="bg-[url(/img/mountains.jpg)] ..."> <div class="backdrop-grayscale ...">div>div><div class="bg-[url(/img/mountains.jpg)] ..."> <div class="backdrop-blur-xs backdrop-grayscale ...">div>div>
You can combine the following backdrop filter utilities: blur, brightness, contrast, grayscale, hue-rotate, invert, opacity, saturate, and sepia.
Removing filters
Use the backdrop-filter-none utility to remove all of the backdrop filters applied to an element:
<div class="backdrop-blur-md backdrop-brightness-150 md:backdrop-filter-none">div>
Using a custom value
Use the backdrop-filter-[] syntax to set the backdrop filter based on a completely custom value:
<div class="backdrop-filter-[url('filters.svg#filter-id')] ..."> div>
For CSS variables, you can also use the backdrop-filter-() syntax:
<div class="backdrop-filter-(--my-backdrop-filter) ..."> div>
This is just a shorthand for backdrop-filter-[var()] that adds the var() function for you automatically.
Applying on hover
Prefix a backdrop-filter utility with a variant like hover:* to only apply the utility in that state:
<div class="backdrop-blur-sm hover:backdrop-filter-none ..."> div>
Learn more about using variants in the variants documentation.
Responsive design
Prefix a backdrop-filter utility with a breakpoint variant like md: to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
<div class="backdrop-blur-sm md:backdrop-filter-none ..."> div>
