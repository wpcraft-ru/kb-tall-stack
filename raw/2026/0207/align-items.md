Utilities for controlling how flex and grid items are positioned along a container's cross axis.
Use the items-stretch utility to stretch items to fill the container's cross axis:
<div class="flex items-stretch ..."> <div class="py-4">01div> <div class="py-12">02div> <div class="py-8">03div>div>
Use the items-start utility to align items to the start of the container's cross axis:
<div class="flex items-start ..."> <div class="py-4">01div> <div class="py-12">02div> <div class="py-8">03div>div>
Use the items-center utility to align items along the center of the container's cross axis:
<div class="flex items-center ..."> <div class="py-4">01div> <div class="py-12">02div> <div class="py-8">03div>div>
Use the items-end utility to align items to the end of the container's cross axis:
<div class="flex items-end ..."> <div class="py-4">01div> <div class="py-12">02div> <div class="py-8">03div>div>
Use the items-baseline utility to align items along the container's cross axis such that all of their baselines align:
<div class="flex items-baseline ..."> <div class="pt-2 pb-6">01div> <div class="pt-8 pb-12">02div> <div class="pt-12 pb-4">03div>div>
Last baseline
Use the items-baseline-last utility to align items along the container's cross axis such that all of their baselines align with the last baseline in the container:
Working on the future of astronaut recruitment at Space Recruit.
<div class="grid grid-cols-[1fr_auto] items-baseline-last"> <div> <img src="img/spencer-sharp.jpg" /> <h4>Spencer Sharph4> <p>Working on the future of astronaut recruitment at Space Recruit.p> div> <p>spacerecruit.comp>div>
This is useful for ensuring that text items align with each other, even if they have different heights.
Responsive design
Prefix an align-items utility with a breakpoint variant like md: to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
<div class="flex items-stretch md:items-center ..."> div>
Learn more about using variants in the variants documentation.
