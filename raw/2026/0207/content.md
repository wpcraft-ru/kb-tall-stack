Utilities for controlling the content of the before and after pseudo-elements.
Basic example
Use the content-[] syntax, along with the before and after variants, to set the contents of the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements:
Higher resolution means more than just a better-quality image. With a Retina 6K display, Pro Display XDR gives you nearly 40 percent more screen real estate than a 5K display.
<p>Higher resolution means more than just a better-quality image. With aRetina 6K display, <a class="text-blue-600 after:content-['_↗']" href="...">Pro Display XDRa> gives you nearly 40 percent more screen real estate thana 5K display.p>
Referencing an attribute value
Use the content-[attr()] syntax to reference a value stored in an attribute using the attr() CSS function:
<p before="Hello World" class="before:content-[attr(before)] ..."> p>
Using spaces and underscores
Since whitespace denotes the end of a class in HTML, replace any spaces in an arbitrary value with an underscore:
<p class="before:content-['Hello_World'] ...">p>
If you need to include an actual underscore, you can do this by escaping it with a backslash:
<p class="before:content-['Hello\_World']">p>
Using a CSS variable
Use the content-() syntax to control the contents of the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements using a CSS variable:
<p class="content-(--my-content)">p>
This is just a shorthand for content-[var()] that adds the var() function for you automatically.
Responsive design
Prefix a content utility with a breakpoint variant like md: to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
<p class="before:content-['Mobile'] md:before:content-['Desktop'] ...">p>
Learn more about using variants in the variants documentation.
