Utilities for controlling how the text of an element overflows.
overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;
Truncating text
Use the truncate utility to prevent text from wrapping and truncate overflowing text with an ellipsis (…) if needed:
The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it is the same as silicosis.
<p class="truncate">The longest word in any of the major...p>
Adding an ellipsis
Use the text-ellipsis utility to truncate overflowing text with an ellipsis (…) if needed:
The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it is the same as silicosis.
<p class="overflow-hidden text-ellipsis">The longest word in any of the major...p>
Clipping text
Use the text-clip utility to truncate the text at the limit of the content area:
The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it is the same as silicosis.
<p class="overflow-hidden text-clip">The longest word in any of the major...p>
This is the default browser behavior.
Responsive design
Prefix a text-overflow utility with a breakpoint variant like md: to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
<p class="text-ellipsis md:text-clip ..."> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...p>
Learn more about using variants in the variants documentation.
