Utilities for controlling how words should be hyphenated.
Preventing hyphenation
Use the hyphens-none utility to prevent words from being hyphenated even if the line break suggestion ­ is used:
Officially recognized by the Duden dictionary as the longest word in German, Kraftfahrzeug­haftpflichtversicherung is a 36 letter word for motor vehicle liability insurance.
<p class="hyphens-none"> ... Kraftfahrzeug&shy;haftpflichtversicherung is a ...p>
Manual hyphenation
Use the hyphens-manual utility to only set hyphenation points where the line break suggestion ­ is used:
Officially recognized by the Duden dictionary as the longest word in German, Kraftfahrzeug­haftpflichtversicherung is a 36 letter word for motor vehicle liability insurance.
<p class="hyphens-manual"> ... Kraftfahrzeug&shy;haftpflichtversicherung is a ...p>
This is the default browser behavior.
Automatic hyphenation
Use the hyphens-auto utility to allow the browser to automatically choose hyphenation points based on the language:
Officially recognized by the Duden dictionary as the longest word in German, Kraftfahrzeughaftpflichtversicherung is a 36 letter word for motor vehicle liability insurance.
<p class="hyphens-auto" lang="de"> ... Kraftfahrzeughaftpflichtversicherung is a ...p>
The line break suggestion ­ will be preferred over automatic hyphenation points.
Responsive design
Prefix a hyphens utility with a breakpoint variant like md: to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
<p class="hyphens-none md:hyphens-auto ..."> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...p>
