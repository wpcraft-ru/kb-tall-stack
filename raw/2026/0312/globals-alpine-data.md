`Alpine.data(...)` provides a way to re-use `x-data` contexts within your application.
Here's a contrived `dropdown` component for example:
```
<div x-data="dropdown">
<button @click="toggle">...button>
<div x-show="open">...div>
div>
<script>
document.addEventListener('alpine:init', () => {
Alpine.data('dropdown', () => ({
open: false,
toggle() {
this.open = ! this.open
}
}))
})
script>
```
As you can see we've extracted the properties and methods we would usually define directly inside `x-data` into a separate Alpine component object.
## [Registering from a bundle](#registering-from-a-bundle)
If you've chosen to use a build step for your Alpine code, you should register your components in the following way:
```
import Alpine from 'alpinejs'
import dropdown from './dropdown.js'
Alpine.data('dropdown', dropdown)
Alpine.start()
```
This assumes you have a file called `dropdown.js` with the following contents:
```
export default () => ({
open: false,
toggle() {
this.open = ! this.open
}
})
```
## [Initial parameters](#initial-parameters)
In addition to referencing `Alpine.data` providers by their name plainly (like `x-data="dropdown"`), you can also reference them as functions (`x-data="dropdown()"`). By calling them as functions directly, you can pass in additional parameters to be used when creating the initial data object like so:
```
<div x-data="dropdown(true)">
```
```
Alpine.data('dropdown', (initialOpenState = false) => ({
open: initialOpenState
}))
```
Now, you can re-use the `dropdown` object, but provide it with different parameters as you need to.
## [Init functions](#init-functions)
If your component contains an `init()` method, Alpine will automatically execute it before it renders the component. For example:
```
Alpine.data('dropdown', () => ({
init() {
// This code will be executed before Alpine
// initializes the rest of the component.
}
}))
```
## [Destroy functions](#destroy-functions)
If your component contains a `destroy()` method, Alpine will automatically execute it before cleaning up the component.
A primary example for this is when registering an event handler with another library or a browser API that isn't available through Alpine.
See the following example code on how to use the `destroy()` method to clean up such a handler.
```
Alpine.data('timer', () => ({
timer: null,
counter: 0,
init() {
// Register an event handler that references the component instance
this.timer = setInterval(() => {
console.log('Increased counter to', ++this.counter);
}, 1000);
},
destroy() {
// Detach the handler, avoiding memory and side-effect leakage
clearInterval(this.timer);
},
}))
```
An example where a component is destroyed is when using one inside an `x-if`:
```
<span x-data="{ enabled: false }">
<button @click.prevent="enabled = !enabled">Togglebutton>
<template x-if="enabled">
<span x-data="timer" x-text="counter">span>
template>
span>
```
## [Using magic properties](#using-magic-properties)
If you want to access magic methods or properties from a component object, you can do so using the `this` context:
```
Alpine.data('dropdown', () => ({
open: false,
init() {
this.$watch('open', () => {...})
}
}))
```
## [Encapsulating directives with `x-bind`](#encapsulating-directives-with-x-bind)
If you wish to re-use more than just the data object of a component, you can encapsulate entire Alpine template directives using `x-bind`.
The following is an example of extracting the templating details of our previous dropdown component using `x-bind`:
```
<div x-data="dropdown">
<button x-bind="trigger">button>
<div x-bind="dialogue">div>
div>
```
```
Alpine.data('dropdown', () => ({
open: false,
trigger: {
['@click']() {
this.open = ! this.open
},
},
dialogue: {
['x-show']() {
return this.open
},
},
}))
```
