Sometimes, when you're using AlpineJS for a part of your template, there is a "blip" where you might see your uninitialized template after the page loads, but before Alpine loads.
`x-cloak` addresses this scenario by hiding the element it's attached to until Alpine is fully loaded on the page.
For `x-cloak` to work however, you must add the following CSS to the page.
```
[x-cloak] { display: none !important; }
```
The following example will hide the tag until its `x-show` is specifically set to true, preventing any "blip" of the hidden element onto screen as Alpine loads.
```
<span x-cloak x-show="false">This will not 'blip' onto screen at any pointspan>
```
`x-cloak` doesn't just work on elements hidden by `x-show` or `x-if`: it also ensures that elements containing data are hidden until the data is correctly set. The following example will hide the tag until Alpine has set its text content to the `message` property.
```
<span x-cloak x-text="message">span>
```
When Alpine loads on the page, it removes all `x-cloak` property from the element, which also removes the `display: none;` applied by CSS, therefore showing the element.
## Alternative to global syntax
If you'd like to achieve this same behavior, but avoid having to include a global style, you can use the following cool, but admittedly odd trick:
```
<template x-if="true">
<span x-text="message">span>
template>
```
This will achieve the same goal as `x-cloak` by just leveraging the way `x-if` works.
Because elements are "hidden" in browsers by default, you won't see the until Alpine has had a chance to render the `x-if="true"` and show it.
Again, this solution is not for everyone, but it's worth mentioning for special cases.
