`x-ref` in combination with `$refs` is a useful utility for easily accessing DOM elements directly. It's most useful as a replacement for APIs like `getElementById` and `querySelector`.
```
<button @click="$refs.text.remove()">Remove Textbutton>
<span x-ref="text">Hello 👋span>
```

> Despite not being included in the above snippet, `x-ref` cannot be used if no parent element has `x-data` defined. [→ Read more about `x-data`](https://alpinejs.dev/directives/data)
